A New-Year’s Bow.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Well</span>, here we are again at the opening
of a new year! It might seem that
New-Year’s day had come so often as to
have lost its interest; that by repetition
it would become stale; that the words,
“I wish you a happy new year!” would
cease to excite the slightest regard. But
it is not so. New-Year’s day seems
always to take us by a kind of pleasant
surprise, and never fails to be welcomed
by old and young, boys and girls. It
has been said by some old writers, that
such anniversaries as this of New-Year’s
day, are, in the journey of life, like milestones
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
along the road, marking the distance
we have travelled, and informing
us of the position we occupy in respect
to the beginning and end of our existence.
If, indeed, we were to use them
as such; if, on New-Year’s day, we
were accustomed to look over our past
lives, to compare what we have done
with what is required of us; to see
when we have performed, and when
failed in, our duty; to mourn over past
errors and neglect, and adopt new resolutions
of improvement for the future—then,
indeed, would New-Year’s day be
an instructive mile-stone on our journey,
a point of reckoning of the greatest benefit;
and then it would not pass by as a
mere thoughtless holiday of pleasant
speeches and profitless amusement.</p>

<p>And why, blue eyes and black eyes!—tell
me why we should not thus use our
New-Year’s day—or at least a little
piece of it? I will not ask you to give
the whole day to a moral lecture. No!
You may partake freely of the frolics and
festivities of the day; you may greet all
your friends and companions with that
pleasant salutation—“A happy new
year!” It is a cheerful sound, especially
when uttered from child to child; from
the child to the parent; from friend to
friend. And you may engage in the
various amusements of the season, as
freely as if old Bob Merry were a child
again, and romping with you, the gayest
of the gay.</p>

<p>But, after your sports are done, just
sit down in the chimney corner, with me.
Don’t be afraid, for I am not about to
scold you; or if I do scold a little, remember
that I shall do it in all kindness;
remember that I am like old Baldwin’s
dog, who had lost his teeth,—my bark is
worse than my bite. So, here we are!
Now sit still, boys; don’t giggle, you
girls! John, Tom, Peter, silence! I
am about to tell you a story of New-Year’s
day.
</p>

<h3 class="ls allsmcap"><a id="v5P2"></a>
THE TWO TRAVELLERS.<br>
</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, two young men,
who were friends, set out to travel in
distant countries. Before they departed,
each one had formed a plan of proceeding.
Horace determined to give himself
up entirely to pleasure; to go wherever
his humor might dictate; and to keep
no records of his adventures. In short,
he resolved to enjoy himself as much as
possible, and by no means to encumber
his mind with cares, duties, or troubles
of any kind.</p>

<p>Ronald was as fond of amusement as
Horace, but the mode he adopted for the
gratification of his wishes was quite
different. In the first place, he made
out a scheme of his travels; he procured
maps, read books, and, after mature deliberation,
adopted a certain route, as
most likely to afford him pleasure as
well as instruction. In the formation of
this plan he spent several weeks, and in
this occupation he found quite as much
satisfaction as he afterwards did in travelling.
Thus he obtained one great advantage
over his idle and luxurious
friend, who foolishly thought that the
essence of enjoyment lay in freedom from
thought, restraint, and toil. Even before
they set out on their journey, Ronald
had actually found nearly as much
pleasure as Horace received in the whole
course of his expedition.</p>

<p>Well; the two young men started together,
and as we are speaking of ancient
days, when there were no coaches,
canals, or railroads, we must tell you
that both set out on foot. They had not
proceeded far before they separated;
Horace taking one road and Ronald
another.</p>

<p>After the lapse of three years they
both returned; but what a difference
between them! Horace was sour and
dissatisfied; he had seen a good deal of
the world, but as he had travelled with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
no other design than to gratify himself
from hour to hour, he had soon exhausted
the cup of pleasure, and found nothing
at the bottom but the bitter dregs of discontent.
He pursued pleasure, till at
last he found the pursuit to be distasteful
and revolting. He grew tired, even
of amusement. He indulged his tastes,
humors, and passions, until indulgence
itself was disgusting. When he returned
to his friends, he had laid up nothing
in his memory, by the relation of which
he could amuse them; he had kept no
record of things he had seen; he brought
back no store of pleasing and useful recollections
for himself, or others. Such
was the result of three years’ travel for
pleasure.</p>

<p>It was quite otherwise with Ronald.
Adhering to his plans, he visited a great
variety of places, and each day he recorded
in his journal what he had seen.
Whenever he met with an interesting
object, he stopped to contemplate it; if
it was some aged relic, famous in history,
he took pains to investigate its story,
and to write it down. If it was an
object of interest to the eye, he made a
sketch of it in the book which he kept
for the purpose.</p>

<p>In this way, Ronald accomplished
three good objects. In the first place,
by taking in pleasure in a moderate way,
and mixed with a little toil and industry,
he prevented that cloying surfeit, which
at last sickened and disgusted Horace.
Horace took pleasure at wholesale, as a
boy eats honey by the spoonful, and soon
got sick of it. Ronald took his honey,
on a slice of bread, and while he enjoyed
it heartily, his appetite continued
as good as before.</p>

<p>In the second place, Ronald greatly
increased his enjoyments by the plan he
adopted. Merely executing a plan is
agreeable, and a source of great pleasure.
It is natural to derive happiness from
following out a design; from seeing
hour by hour, day by day, how results
come about, in conformity to our intentions.
But this was not the only advantage
which Ronald received from his
system. The very toil he bestowed;
the investigations he made; the pleasant
thoughts and curious knowledge
that were unfolded to his mind; the excitement
he found in his exertions; the
pleasure he took in drawing picturesque
scenes; all these things constituted a
rich harvest of pleasure, which was
wholly denied to Horace. Thus it was
that labor and industry, exerted in carrying
out a plan, afforded the young traveller
a vast deal of gratification. The
very things that Horace looked upon as
hateful, were, in fact, the sources of his
rival’s most permanent enjoyment.</p>

<p>In the third place, Ronald had come
back laden with rich stores of knowledge,
observation and experience. Not
only was his journal rich in tales, legends,
scenes, incidents, and historical
records, but in putting these things down
on paper, his memory had been improved,
and he had acquired the habit of
observing and remembering. His mind
was full of pleasant things, and nothing
could be more interesting than to sit
down and hear him tell of his travels,
and of what he had seen. While Horace
was dull, silent, and sour, Ronald was
full of conversation, life, and interest.
The one was happy, the other unhappy;
one was agreeable, the other disagreeable;
one had exhausted the cup of pleasure,
the other seemed always to have
the cup full and sparkling before him.
It was agreed on all hands, that Horace
was a bore, and everybody shunned him;
while Ronald was considered by all a
most agreeable fellow, and everybody
sought his society.</p>

<p>So much for the two travellers; one,
a luxurious lover of pleasure, who
thought only of the passing moment,
and in his folly, abused and threw away
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
his powers of enjoyment; the other, a
lover of pleasure also, but who pursued
it moderately, with a wise regard to the
future, and careful attention, every day,
to rules of duty; and who thus secured
his true happiness.</p>

<p>Now, my young friends, this is rather
a dull story; but there is truth in it.
Though it be New-Year’s day, still,
remember that every day has its duties,
for those who would live and be happy,
like our hero, Ronald. And what is the
peculiar duty of this day? Let me tell
you.</p>

<p>We should all of us consider the past
year; and reflect whether we have done
our duty to God, to our neighbor, and to
ourselves. Do we love our Maker, our
Redeemer, better than when the past
year opened upon us? Is our reverence,
our confidence, in him stronger? Do
we live more habitually in his presence?
Do we yearn more and more to please
him, to be like him?</p>

<p>Do we love our friends, neighbors, all
that we see and meet, better? Are we
more ready to forgive injuries? More
earnest to promote peace? More self-sacrificing;
more regardful of the feelings,
wants, and wishes of others? Are
we carefully cultivating the garden of
the heart; cherishing its flowers, and
weeding out its noxious passions?</p>

<p>These are questions which we should
put to ourselves, this New-Year’s evening;
and if we can answer them in the
affirmative, it is well; but if not, let us
make new and vigorous resolutions to
give a better account of the opening
year.</p>

<p>Do not be frightened from your duty
by the idea that such thoughts as these
I suggest, are distasteful or painful, remember
the story of the two travellers;
remember that if you adopt a good plan,
the pursuit of it will unfold new and unexpected
pleasures. Remember that all
play and no reflection, is like unmixed
honey, cloying to the appetite; remember
that a mixture of duty enhances
pleasure itself, at the same time improving
the faculties and keeping the relish
always fresh. And remember one thing
more, which is this: the heart needs
your constant care. Let me ask your
attention to a homely practice in the
country—that of putting down a barrel
of meat. You notice that a quantity of
salt is always put into it; for we all
know that otherwise the meat would become
an offensive mass. It is so with
the human heart: it needs the salt—it
needs a sense of duty, to keep it from
spoiling! Oh, my young friends, think
of this; and save your bosoms from becoming
tainted with sin, and vice, and
crime!</p>

<h2>
Fidelity of a Negro Servant.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. L.</span>, a respectable gentleman, was
confined for some time in the King’s
Bench prison, London, while his fortune,
on account of a law-suit, was unjustly
withheld from him. During this
distress, he was obliged to tell his negro
servant, that, however painful to his
feelings, they must part; his difficulties
being so great that he was unable to
provide for him the necessaries of life.
The negro, whose name was Bob, replied,
“No, master, we will never part.
Many a year have you kept me and fed
me, and clothed me, and treated me
kindly; and now I will keep you.” Accordingly,
Bob went out to work as a
day-laborer; and, at the end of every
week, faithfully brought his earnings to
his master. These proved sufficient for
the support of them both, until, the law-suit
being ended, Dr. L. became possessed
of a large fortune. He then settled
a handsome sum on his faithful
servant.</p>

The Maple Tree Temple at Matibo, in Italy.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> beautiful tree which our engraving
represents, is one of the most curious
ornaments of a charming estate called
Matibo, situated in the neighborhood of
Savigliano, in Piedmont. It was planted
more than sixty years ago, but it is
not more than twenty-five or thirty years
since the idea was started of making it
grow in the form of a temple, which, after
much time and perseverance, was completely
realized.</p>

<p>This elegant little edifice consists of
two stories, each of which has eight
windows, and is capable of containing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
twenty persons. The floors are formed
of branches twined together with great
skill, and by nature are covered with
leafy carpets; all round the verdure has
formed thick walls, where a great number
of birds have taken up their sojourn.</p>

<h2>
The Lost Found.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the south-eastern part of France is
a range of mountains called the Cevennes.
The highest points are about as
elevated as Mount Washington, in New
Hampshire. These mountains are remarkable
for their wild, rugged, and broken
character, and for the furious storms
and tempests to which they are subject.
In winter the snow falls to a great depth,
and sometimes the inhabitants, being
buried in the drifts, cut arch-ways beneath,
and thus pass from one house to
another.</p>

<p>These wild regions are not only celebrated
in history as being the places of refuge
to which the Huguenots retreated during
their fearful and bloody persecution—about
two hundred and fifty years ago—but
as producing a race of people of peculiarly
adventurous habits. Surrounded
by natural objects of a savage aspect—grisly
rocks, dark cavernous ravines—and
trees hoary with age; their memories
tinged with the traditionary romances
attached to their ancestors; battling day
by day with a sterile soil and a rugged
climate for subsistence; often disputing
with the bear and the wolf their very
habitations; and, above all, touched with
the lights and shadows of religion, mingled
with various superstitions; these
people present an interesting subject of
regard to the student of human nature.
Leaving them to the philosophers, however,
it is our present design merely to
tell a story which may shed some little
light on the modes of life which prevail
among these people.</p>

<p>In a little hamlet embosomed in the
mountains, lived Pierre Bec, a poor laborer,
with his only daughter, Aimee.
Their house was of rough stone, laid in
mud, and covered with pieces of bark
as a roof. Here they dwelt with no
other companions than a dog, named
Tonnerre, which, in English, means
<em>thunder</em>.</p>

<p>Aimee’s mother died when she was
an infant; and after she could run alone,
the little girl was left pretty much to
her own guidance. The hamlet where
she dwelt, consisted of only a dozen hovels,
much like her own home. These
were situated on an elevated ridge, in
the very bosom of the mountain, and
surrounded with wooded cliffs and dizzy
precipices. A scene more wild, remote
and lonely could scarcely be imagined.</p>

<p>Here Aimee grew to the age of nine
years, and at that period she had not only
become familiar with the scenes around,
but, like the wild goats, she could climb
the cliffs and thread the dells as fearlessly
as if she had wings to support her, in
case her foot should slide. Nor was
this all. She could even go to the market
town of Laperdu, a distance of seven
miles, and return in the course of the
day, having carried and sold a pair of
stockings which had been made with
her own hands.</p>

<p>In all these mountain excursions, old
Tonnerre was the constant companion
of Aimee, and he contributed not a
little to her amusement. His activity
knew no bounds. He must plunge into
every thicket; put his head into every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
cave and crevice; smell up the larger
trees; course through the ravines, and
take, in short, a careful survey of the
country over which they passed. He
must banter with every squirrel that
took refuge in the trees, daring him
down with many a noisy shout. He
must give chase to every hare that
glanced across his path. He must mark
the track of the wolf and bear with cries
and howls of defiance, though in such
cases he used to keep near his mistress,
either for her safety or his own.</p>

<p>Such was Aimee, and such old
Tonnerre, the hero and heroine of our
tale, when, on a fine summer morning,
they set out on a visit to Laperdu.
They reached the place, and on their return
were about two miles from their
home, when one of the violent thunder
storms, common in the mountains, began
to darken the sky. It was already sunset,
and in a few minutes the darkness became
intense; at the same time the rain
began to fall in torrents. In a short space,
the ravines were spouting with waterfalls,
and torrents were dashing madly
down the glens. At the same time the
roar of the thunder was perpetual, and
the lightning, flash on flash, seemed to
array the scene in garments of fire.
Accustomed to such scenes, Aimee
pushed on, following the lead of the
dog, who kept close, and with fidgety
anxiety turned round at every step to
fortify her heart with a look of cheerfulness
and courage. There was that in
his face which seemed to say, “Don’t
mind it, my dear little mistress—don’t
mind it—it’s nothing but thunder and
lightning, and wind, and rain, and tempest,
and dark night, and we’ll get the better
of it all, yet. Keep a good heart, and
we’ll soon be home!”</p>

<p>Aimee did keep a good heart, but the
storm was indeed fearful; and at last a
bolt of lightning, falling upon a tree near
by, tore it in splinters, and dashed the
little girl to the ground. Here she lay,
in a state of insensibility. The dog
came to her side, and in a beseeching
howl, seemed to try to awaken her.
He at last began licking her face, but all
was in vain. He remained with the poor
girl till it was near morning, when, having
used every art and device of which he
was master, to recall her to consciousness,
he set off with a round gallop for
the hamlet. Panting and out of breath,
he rushed up to his master, and with a
piteous howl, did all he could to tell his
melancholy story.</p>

<p>Pierre knew at once that something
had befallen his child. He instantly
announced his fears to his neighbors,
who rallied at his call, and set out in
search of Aimee. Her absence during
the night had been remarked, and all the
people had feared some accident, though
Pierre had solaced himself with the idea
that Aimee had been kept at Laperdu
by the storm.</p>

<p>Tonnerre took the lead, and bounded
forward like a deer. He went in long
leaps, his hinder heels flying high in the
air at every jump. He whined, howled,
and came often back upon his track, as if
to hasten forward the too tardy party. At
last Pierre, who was the most anxious,
and the leader of the group, came near
the place where Aimee had fallen. The
dog then leaped forward, and placing
himself by the side of the girl, once more
licked her face. She instantly raised
herself so as to sit up, and putting her
arms around the neck of her friend, embraced
him, while the tears began to
flow down her cheeks. Her father soon
arrived, and the rest of the party coming
up, all were rejoiced to find the poor
girl unhurt. She was a little bewildered,
and it was not until after several
minutes, that she was able to tell her
story. At last she arose upon her feet,
on her wooden shoes, which had been
knocked off by the lightning, and went
home.</p>

<p>An occasion like this, would be noticed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
with pleasure, in any country; but
these wild mountaineers appear to be
peculiarly sensible to everything that is
beautiful, even though it be but a display
of the activity with which animals
are endowed by their Creator.
Accordingly, the tale we have told,
was commemorated by an anniversary;
every year, on the day in
which the event occurred, the people
used to go to a wild spot in the mountain,
where a dog was wreathed with
flowers, in honor of the feats of old
Tonnerre.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
The Snow Man.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the sports of winter, I know of
none that used to delight me more, when
I was a boy, than the making of a snow
man. To do this successfully, it required
what is called a moist snow, so
that it would adhere like mortar, and
take any desirable shape.</p>

<p>And of all the fellows I ever knew, for
this kind of sculpture, Bill Keeler—the
companion of my early days—was the
cleverest. He could indeed turn his
hand to anything, and such was his dexterity,
that whatever was going forward,
he seemed always to take the lead. If
we were skating, Bill was sure to cut
the most fantastic circles and evolutions,
and beat the best at a race. If we were
leaping, Bill went just an inch further
than the largest boys of the party. At a
hop, either on the left or right foot, he
surpassed his competitors by a quarter
of a yard. In setting a trap for a woodchuck;
smoking out a fox; coming Yankee
over a rat; making wind-mills, kites,
or chestnut whistles, Bill was the transcendent
workman of the village.</p>

<p>But in nothing was his genius more
conspicuous than in making a snow man.
In this, as in sculpture, the great art
lies more in the model, the design, than
the finish. Bill’s figures, in this line,
always meant something. He did not
leave the effect to accident—not he!
He knew what he was about, and could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
always accomplish, by the skill of his
hand, what his mind conceived. I remember
one remarkable instance of
this.</p>

<p>In the days of which I speak, economy
was a great point in matters touching
the town-school; and consequently it
was customary to employ cheap schoolmasters.
A man who failed in everything
else, was supposed to be fit to teach
a school. According to this rule, one
William Picket, was deemed worthy to
preside over the West Lane Seminary,
in Salem, some forty years ago, particularly
as he underbid everybody else.</p>

<p>Picket was essentially a dunce, and
believed that there was more sense,
knowledge, and virtue in a birch stick,
than in anything else. Accordingly, his
chief efforts consisted in applying it to
his pupils. At the same time he was a
man of uncouth appearance. His neck
was long—his nose prominent—the nostrils
flaring, and always lined with
snuff. His ears were large, and stood
aloof from his head, like two mushrooms
upon sharp stones.</p>

<p>Well, during the administration of
Mr. William Picket, there came a fall
of snow, about two feet deep, moist and
malleable,—and “hurra!” it was for a
snow man! Bill, who, by this time, was
as celebrated in this species of fine art, as
our Boston Greenough is in making
marble statues, at once took the matter
in hand. Up rolled the snow in huge
masses, and Bill stood ready to give it
shape and conformation. I recollect perfectly
well the queer, quizzical air with
which he presided over the operation.
He said nothing, but held the point of
his tongue, half twisted, like an auger,
between his teeth.</p>

<p>The image grew into life rapidly, beneath
his magic hand. At last it was
done, and all at once the wonderful resemblance
it bore to the schoolmaster
flashed upon the spectators. What a
shout rose to the sky! The long neck—the
trumpet-shaped proboscis—the flaring
ears—it was impossible to mistake
them—it was impossible to resist the ludicrous
likeness.</p>

<p>Many a wild thought was now suggested.
“Let us give him a lesson in
birch!” said one. “Let us snowball
him!” said another. But all this time
Master Picket was looking out of the
school-house window, and I must say
that he had the sense to take the joke.
Alas for poor Bill! how his jacket was
strapped that day! But so it is—genius
is often made to suffer, and my friend
consoled himself that, like many great
men whose story is told in history, his
very cleverness was the cause of his misfortunes.</p>

<span class="smcap">An Intelligent Horse.</span>—We read
an anecdote the other day of a horse in
England, belonging to a brewery, which is
so tractable that he is left without restraint,
to walk about the yard, and return
to the stable as he pleases. In this
yard there are some pigs, which are fed
entirely on grain and corn, which the
horse has taken a great dislike to. This
he manifests in the most striking manner.
There is a deep trough in the
yard, which holds water for the horses,
to which this one goes alone, with his
mouth full of corn, which he saves from
his own supply. When he reaches the
trough, he lets the corn fall near it on
the ground, and when the young swine
approach to eat it, he suddenly seizes
one by the tail, pops him into the trough,
and then capers about the yard, seemingly
delighted with the frolic. The
noise of the pig soon brings the men to
his assistance, who know from experience
what is the matter, while the horse
indulges in all kinds of antics, and then
quietly returns to the stable.</p>

True Stories.<br>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A Warning to Thoughtless Boys.</span>—In
the autumn of 1842, as the Queen
of the Isles steamer was on her passage
from Liverpool to Douglas, Isle of Man,
when about thirty miles from her destination,
Mr. M’Fee, the chief mate, discerned
an object at some distance in the
water, and, on approaching it more nearly,
it turned out to be a small boat, about
four or five miles distant. On viewing
the object with his telescope, he could
see a person sitting in the stern, apparently
in distress, and he immediately
ordered the steamer to make all possible
despatch towards the boat, and made
every necessary preparation to render
assistance.</p>

<p>On nearing the boat, a little boy was
plainly seen using an almost expiring
effort to keep it in the direction of the
steamer, which was soon very near it.
A rope was immediately thrown out,
which the lad seized with a convulsive
effort. To describe the scene when the
boat was alongside the steamer is impossible—it
was most heart-rending. There
sat a little boy, twelve years of age, the
boat having in it six inches depth of
water, and the youth almost in a state
of nudity, without shoes or stockings,
cold and emaciated—indeed, all but
dead. When on board the steamer he
was immediately conveyed to bed, and
Mr. Sigston, surgeon, who was a passenger,
took him under his special care,
and rendered every possible assistance
and attention which his deplorable situation
required.</p>

<p>When the vessel arrived at Douglas,
the little fellow was given into the charge
of the town surgeon, and has since been
doing well. It turned out that the lad,
whose name is Barney Smith, had, along
with several other lads about his own
age, got into the boat on Saturday evening,
when it was anchored on the
Douglas Sands; the other lads leaped
out of the boat, took up the anchor, and
pushed poor Barney off to sea.</p>

<p>They at once discovered the mischief
they had done, and, being afraid of the
consequences, ran away and did not
mention the circumstance. Poor Barney
was consequently drifted out to sea,
and had remained afloat from Saturday
till the time when he was providentially
taken up by the steamer, at
four o’clock on Tuesday afternoon, a
space of three days and three nights.
He had a small quantity of meal and a
little bread in a bag, of which he states
he did not eat, as his thirst was so intolerable
and his mouth so dry and parched,
that he could not swallow it. He had
only had salt water to drink, which increased
his thirst, and he fancies that he
slept one whole night and day. There
can be no doubt that he had an almost
miraculous delivery, as, soon after he
was taken up, there was a severe gale
and a heavy sea.—<cite>Carlisle Patriot.</cite></p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="v5P10a"></a>
Kindness and Sagacity of the Ass.</span>
The following anecdote of the sagacity
of an ass, and the attachment displayed
by the animal to his master, may help,
in some degree, to redeem that ill-used
race from a portion of the <em>load</em> of stupidity
which is generally assigned to
them, and which, with so many other
<em>loads</em>, they bear with such exemplary
patience.</p>

<p>Thomas Brown, residing near Hawick,
England, travelled the country as a pedler,
having an ass, the partner of his
trade. From suffering under a paralytic
affection, he was in the habit of assisting
himself on the road by keeping hold
of the crupper of the saddle, or more
frequently the <em>tail</em> of the ass. During a
severe winter, some years ago, whilst on
one of his journeys, near Rule water,
“the old man and his ass” were suddenly
plunged into a wreath of snow.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
There they lay long, far from help, and
ready to perish. At length the poor ass,
after a severe struggle, got out; but
finding his unfortunate master absent,
he eyed the wreath for some time with
a wistful look, and at last forced his way
through it to where his master still lay,
when, placing his body in such a position
as to afford a firm grasp of the tail, the
honest pedler was thereby enabled to
take his accustomed hold, and was actually
dragged out by the faithful beast to
a place of safety!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="v5P11a"></a>A Test of Christianity.</span> A Christian
gentleman had occasion to travel
through a new and thickly-settled part
of the western country. His companion
was a man of intelligence, but of infidel
principles, who was fond of discussion,
and tried to beguile the way by urging
arguments against the truth of the
Christian religion. The thinly peopled
section of country through which they
were passing, was inhabited by people of
bad reputation, and it had been rumored
that travellers had suffered fatal violence
from them when they were within their
power.</p>

<p>As regular inns were unknown, our
travellers were compelled to trust to the
hospitality of those of whom they could
not but entertain a secret fear. On one
occasion, as the evening closed in, they
sought a lodging-place in a log cabin,
far remote from other habitations. They
anticipated but little comfort; and were
induced to believe that it would be a
measure of safety to watch alternately
through the night.</p>

<p>As they were about to retire to their
rude bed, their host, whose exterior
had excited their distrust, proceeding to
a shelf, took down an old and much
worn Bible, and informing his visiters
that it was his custom to worship God in
his family, he read and prayed in so
simple and sincere a manner as to secure
the esteem of the travellers. They
retired to rest, slept soundly, and thought
no more of alternate watching.</p>

<p>In the morning, the Christian requested
his infidel companion to say whether
the religious exercises of the preceding
evening had not dispelled every particle
of distrust of their host’s character, and
had not enabled him to close his eyes in
the most confident security. He was
evidently embarrassed by the question;
but at length he candidly acknowledged
that the sight of the Bible had secured
him a sound night’s rest. Here was a
testimony, extorted from an infidel, in
favor of the influence of the religion
which he skeptically assailed. He could
not harbor a fear of violence from one
who was in the habit of daily bending
his knee before God! The very erection
of the family altar rendered the
house a secure asylum! Who would
not be a Christian? Who can be an
infidel?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="v5P11b"></a>
A Tahitian Christian.</span> Maree, a
native of the island of Otaheite or Tahiti,
was a man of fine natural talents
and was not destitute of acquired ones;
being able to read and write well, and
acquainted with some of the first rules
of arithmetic. He was possessed of a
surprising memory, a quick perception,
and a good understanding, with a sound
and penetrating judgment; while, to
crown all, he was a man of genuine
piety and ardent zeal in the Savior’s
cause. He was one of the first, who,
under the preaching of the missionaries,
publicly embraced Christianity
among these islanders; and before it
became general, his life was often in
jeopardy, through his profession of it.
More than one attempt was made, by a
number of violent men, to shoot him and
a little praying company, who used to
meet with him that they might together
worship the true God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
On one occasion, these lawless men
having found him and his little party at
prayer in a place appropriated for the
purpose, levelled their muskets at them,
with a view to execute their cruel designs,
when, as though withheld by an
unseen arm, their attention was arrested
by the prayers offering up by the intended
victims of their fury. The effect
was instantaneous and powerful. Abandoning
their murderous purpose, they
went in and sat down with Maree and
his company, confessed what their intentions
had been, and told them not to
be afraid, as they should not molest them
any more; which promise they kept.</p>

<p>Maree was much respected among the
people, both for his piety and talents,
and also, as having been made a judge
from the esteem entertained for him by
Pomare, the king; because, as the latter
used to say, “he had embraced Christianity
at the mouth of the musket,” and
for his persevering attachment to his
profession, and moreover, as the king
said, “because he knew Maree would
regard the laws and do justice.”</p>

<p>“I have by long and sound experience
found that the due observance of this
day and the duties of it hath been of
singular comfort and advantage to me.
The observance of this day hath ever
had joined to it a blessing upon the rest
of my time; and the week that hath been
so begun hath been blessed and prospered
to me; and, on the other side,
when I have been negligent of the duties
of this day, the rest of the week has
been unsuccessful and unhappy to my
own secular employments; so that I
could easily make an estimate of my
successes the week following, by the
manner of my passing this day; and
this I do not write lightly or inconsiderately,
but upon a long and sound observation
and experience.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">David Saunders,—the Shepherd of
Salisbury Plain.</span><a id="v5P12b"></a>
Most of our readers
are acquainted with that beautiful story,
written by Hannah More, entitled “The
Shepherd of Salisbury Plain.” The
substance of this narrative is a correct
account of David Saunders, of West
Lavington, England, who died about the
period of its publication. The conversation
represented as passing between the
shepherd and a Mr. Johnston, really
took place with Dr. Stonehouse, a
neighboring clergyman, who befriended
the shepherd on many occasions.</p>

<p>Dr. Stonehouse, who was on a journey,
and somewhat fearful, from the appearance
of the sky, that rain was at
hand, accosted the shepherd by asking
him what sort of weather it would be on
the morrow. “It will be such weather
as pleases me!” said the shepherd.
Though the answer was delivered in
the mildest and civilest tone that could
be imagined, Dr. S. thought the words
themselves rather rude and surly, and
asked him how that could be. “Because,”
replied the shepherd, “it will
be such weather as pleases God, and
whatever pleases him, always pleases
me.”</p>

<p>Dr. S. was quite satisfied with this
reply, and entered into conversation with
the shepherd in the following manner:
“Yours is a troublesome life, honest
friend.” “To be sure, sir,” replied the
shepherd, “’tis not a very lazy life; but
’tis not near so toilsome as that which
my Great Master led for my sake. He
had every state and condition of life at
his choice, and chose a hard one, while
I only submit to the lot that is appointed
me.” “You are exposed to great cold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
and heat,” said the gentleman. “True,
sir,” said the shepherd; “but then, I
am not exposed to great temptations;
and so throwing one thing against
another, God is pleased to contrive to
make things more equal than we poor,
ignorant, short-sighted creatures are apt
to think. David was happier when he
kept his father’s sheep, on such a plain
as this, and singing some of his own
psalms, perhaps, than ever he was when
he became king of Israel and Judah; and
I dare say we should never have had
some of the most beautiful texts in all
those fine psalms, if he had not been a
shepherd, which enabled him to make so
many fine comparisons and similitudes,
as one may say, from a country life,
flocks of sheep, hills, valleys and fountains
of water.”</p>

<p>“You think, then,” said the gentleman,
“that a laborious life is a happy
one?”</p>

<p>“I do, sir, and more especially so as
it exposes a man to fewer sins. If king
Saul had continued a poor laborious
man to the end of his days, he might
have lived happy and honest, and died a
natural death in his bed at last; which
you know, sir, was more than he did.
But, I speak with reverence, for it was
divine Providence overruled all that,
you know, sir, and I do not presume to
make comparisons. Beside, sir, my employment
has been particularly honored.
Moses was a shepherd in the plains of
Midian. It was to shepherds keeping
their flocks by night, that the angels
appeared in Bethlehem, to tell the best
news—the gladdest tidings that were
ever revealed to poor sinful men; often
and often has the thought warmed my
poor heart in the coldest night, and filled
me with more joy and thankfulness than
the best supper could have done.”</p>

<p>This poor shepherd had indeed a
depth of wisdom, which infinitely surpassed
that of many learned philosophers.
How often have they studied
the ways of God, without being able to
discern them—while all was plain to
David Saunders.</p>

<span class="smcap">An Indian’s Illustration of Scripture.</span>
Some years ago one of the
preachers of the Mohegan Indians, near
Norwich, in Connecticut, was preaching
on the language of Solomon, “Cast thy
bread upon the waters, for thou shalt
find it after many days.” Eccles. xi. 1.
To illustrate his subject, and enforce the
duty of benevolence, he related a circumstance
connected with his early days,
as follows: “A certain man was going
from Norwich to New London, with a
loaded team; on attempting to ascend
the hill where Indian lives, he found his
team could not draw the load; he came
to Indian, and got him to help him with
his oxen. After he had got up, he asked
Indian what there was to pay. Indian
told him to do as much for somebody
else.</p>

<p>“Some time afterward, Indian wanted
a canoe; he went up Shetucket river,
found a tree and made him one. When
he got it done, he could not get it to the
river; accordingly, he went to a man,
and offered him all the money he had,
if he would go and draw it to the river
for him. The man said he would go.
After getting it to the river, Indian
offered to pay him. ‘No,’ said the man;
‘don’t you recollect, so long ago, helping
a man up the hill by your house?’
‘Yes.’ ‘Well, I am the man; take
your canoe and go home.’ So I find
it after many days.”</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
The Narval, or Sea-Unicorn.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> all the variety of weapons
with which nature has armed her various
tribes, there is not one so large or
so formidable as the tusk of the narval.
This terrible weapon is generally found
single, and some are of opinion that the
animal is only furnished with one by
nature; but there is ample proof of instances
to the contrary, for a narval with
two teeth was for some time to be
seen at the Stadthouse, at Amsterdam.
The tooth, or horn of the sea-unicorn,
is as straight as an arrow,
is wreathed, and tapers to a sharp
point; and is whiter, heavier, and
harder than ivory.</p>

<p>The form of the sea-unicorn, as may
be seen from the engraving prefixed to
this article, resembles that of the dolphin,
the head being about the seventh
part of the body; the mouth is exceedingly
small when compared to the enormous
bulk of the animal, the eyes keen,
and the nostrils placed on the top of the
head.</p>

<p>The narval varies in color according
to age; when young, the back is grayish,
with small spots of a dark hue; and
when full grown, is whitish, with small
brown or gray spots, which vary much
in their depth of color.</p>

<p>The sea-unicorn is generally found
about Greenland and Iceland, but it is
said that one has been seen near Boston.
They swim with great rapidity,
and are rendered formidable by their
tusks, which they sometimes bury in
the sides of a ship, or in the body of
the whale. They are generally seen
in numbers, and whenever they are
attacked they crowd together in such
a manner that they embarrass each
other by their tusks.</p>

<p>“We one day saw,” says Scoresby, in
his ‘Voyage to Greenland,’ “a great
number of narvals, that swam near us in
parties of fifteen to twenty; the majority
of them were males, and had very
long horns, or tusks, and seemed to be
enjoying themselves by raising their
horns above the water, and crossing
them as if fencing. During their play
they made a very strange noise, as if
water were gurgling in their throats,
which was probably the case, as the
noise was only heard when they lifted
their heads above the water. The greater
number, apparently attracted by curiosity,
followed the vessel, and as the
water was clear, we could plainly see
them go down to the keel and play with
the rudder.”</p>

<p>The narval lives upon small fish, and
not, as Cravez has asserted, upon sea-plants.
Scoresby, in the following passage,
confirms our <span class="lock">statement:—</span></p>

<p>“My father sent me the contents of
the stomach of a narval, which appeared
to me very extraordinary. It consisted
of small fishes half digested with the
bones and fins of others, besides the
fragments of cuttlefish, which seemed to
constitute its principal food. There was
a part of the back-bone of a turbot, fragments
of another, with one almost entire—this
was about two feet three inches
long, and one foot eight inches broad.
It is strange that the narval, without
teeth, and having a very small mouth,
apparently inflexible lips, and a short
tongue, is able to seize and swallow a
fish about three times larger than its
mouth. As the animal in which these
extraordinary contents were found was
a male, with a tusk of seven feet, I think
that this weapon had been used to catch
the fish which had recently been made
his prey. It is probable that the turbot
had been pierced and killed before devoured,
otherwise it is difficult to imagine
how the narval was able to seize it,
or how a fish of such activity as the turbot
would allow itself to be taken by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
one with smooth lips, without teeth to
catch, and without the means of holding
it.”</p>

<p>The sea-unicorn, like the whale, is
often used as food, and is, in fact, more
valuable than any other cetaceous animal,
as the oil which it furnishes is considered
the best.</p>

<p>An anecdote relative to narval fishing,
which we believe to be true, may
not be unacceptable to our readers.</p>

<p class="p2">Etienne Turgot was one of the most
respectable fishermen of Greenland, and
from his expertness in spearing and harpooning
the narval and the whale, was
respected by all his craft. He had a
wife, on whom he doted; and a son, a
boy of seven years of age, whose daring
disposition and fear-nought character
were often the cause of many a sad hour
to the mother; but it warmed the father’s
heart to see in his offspring the same
wild spirit that had characterized his
own young days,—to hear of a miraculous
escape, which reminded him of
some of the hazardous scenes of his own
daring boyhood.</p>

<p>For several months the son (Pierre,)
had his mind bent on going out on a
fishing excursion with his father; and
when the parent returned home at night,
the first thing that saluted his ears was,
“Father, I must go to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The indulgent parent, after much persuasion,
at last consented; and the following
morning was fixed for the desired
expedition.</p>

<p>Pierre slept but little; for his night
was spent in dreams. At one time he
was chased by a whale, or some other
monster of the deep; at another he was
making his way home with one on his
back. At last morning came, and up he
got to wake his father; and shortly
afterwards they were gliding along in
their light boat—the parent on the look-out
for narvals, the son gazing into the
crystal element, shouting, from time to
<span class="lock">time,—</span></p>

<p>“Oh! what a fish; I wish I could
reach it!”</p>

<p>Thus they moved onwards, the father
casting an occasional affectionate glance
on the son, while the latter was too busy
to see anything but the small fishes that
were sporting beneath him.</p>

<p>After gazing for some time on the
broad expanse of water, Etienne imagined
that he saw something resembling
a fish moving on the surface. On drawing
nearer he perceived a horn projecting
three feet out of the water, and
nothing daunted, <span class="lock">exclaimed,—</span></p>

<p>“Ah, ah; a narval!” Scarcely had
he uttered these words, when he heard
a plunge behind him; and on turning
round, he discovered that his son had
fallen into the water. The fond parent
was about to plunge after him, when his
eye caught sight of the tooth of the narval,
which was rapidly gliding towards
the place where Pierre was. Etienne
stood for a moment horror-struck, gazing
wildly at his son as he came up gurgling
to the surface, then on the huge creature
that was threatening to destroy the object
of his affection. That presence of
mind which had characterized his former
actions in time of danger, did not forsake
him at this critical moment. He seized
his spear, fixed his keen eye upon the
frightful animal, raised himself in the
boat, and, aiming a thrust at its head,
plunged into the water. For a moment
nothing was to be seen; neither the
father, son, nor fish. All was as if nothing
had taken place, save that the
water round the boat was tinctured with
blood. Was it that of one, or all of them?
No, not of all; for, a few moments afterwards,
Etienne reached the surface,
bearing in his arms his cherished boy.</p>

<p>When once more safely seated in the
boat, the father and son looked everywhere
for the wounded fish and the lost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
spear; but their search was in vain. At
last they returned home; and on the
husband telling his beloved spouse of
the danger they had run, the terrified
mother began to scold Pierre for his
temerity; but the boy, accustomed to
such rebukes, <span class="lock">replied,—</span></p>

<p>“Ah, mother; if you had seen what
a beauty it was, you would not scold
me. If my arm had been a little longer
I am sure I should have caught it.”</p>

<p>Years have elapsed; and, in spite of
all Pierre’s solicitations, the prudent
mother would not again hear of his accompanying
his father on another fishing
excursion.</p>

<h2>
The Effects of Music on Animals.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Music</span> exercises extraordinary effects
upon certain animals, and fully confirms
the remark of Racine, that “Nature has
given ears sensible of harmony even to
brutes.” We shall find that music subdues
the rude dispositions of some;
arouses the ferocity of others; renders
some so docile and tame, that they may
be approached without hesitation; while
it makes others suspicious and frightened.</p>

<p>Gregory Nicene tells us of an <em>ape</em>, in
the city of Alexandria, which, clothed in
very rich attire, used to dance very exactly
to music. Once he had continued
the dance for a long time; but a beholder,
having thrown him some nuts, he immediately
left off dancing, and began to
gather them, amidst the loud laughter
of the spectators.</p>

<p>Old Franzius, a moralizing zoologist,
compares this ape’s conduct to that of
those men in high office, who will neglect
the public whenever private gain
offers itself to them. This writer says,
“a <em>bear</em> is extraordinarily delighted
with music.”</p>

<p>Paulus Diaconus and Olaus Magnus
tell us, that “there are multitudes of bears
in the south, which oftentimes will come
to the shepherds and make them play to
them till hunger forceth them to go
away; and as soon as they are gone,
the shepherd will sound his horn, by
which they are so affrighted that they
will never come any more.”</p>

<p>Many <em>dogs</em> appear to be fond of music.
Mr. Jesse observes, that “there is
hardly a regimental band in the British
service which is not attended by some
particular dog, who owns no master, but
picks up his living where he can; in
fact, attaches itself to the band, and follows
it from one quarter to another.
These dogs are great favorites with the
soldiers, and they never ill-use them or
suffer others to do so.”</p>

<p><abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Marville says, that while a man
was playing upon a conch shell, he noticed
a dog sitting on its hind legs looking
steadfastly at the player for above
an hour; and <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Le Cat observes, that
we hear a dog howl, we see him weep,
as it were, at a tune played upon a flute;
but we see him quite lively in a field, at
the sound of a French horn.</p>

<p>Bowyer states, that “a Scotch bagpiper
traversing the mountains of Ulster,
in Ireland, was one evening encountered
by a starved <em>wolf</em>. In his distress, the
poor man could think of nothing better
than to open his wallet, and try the effects
of his hospitality; he did so, and
the savage swallowed all that was
thrown to him with such a voracity that
it seemed as if his appetite was just returning
to him. The whole stock of provision
was, of course, soon spent, and now
his only recourse was to the virtues of
his bagpipe; this the monster no sooner
heard, than he took to the mountains
with the same precipitation with which
he had left them. The poor piper could
not so perfectly enjoy his deliverance,
but that, with an angry look at parting,
he shook his head, saying, ‘Ay, are
these your tricks? had I known your
humor, you should have had your music
before supper.’”</p>

<p>Sparrman furnishes us with an anecdote
of a trumpeter, who, by a similar
expedient, saved himself from falling a
prey to a prowling hyæna:—“One
night,” he says, “at a feast near the
Cape, a trumpeter, who had got himself
well filled with liquor, was carried out
of doors, in order to cool and sober him.
The scent of him soon attracted a <em>spotted
hyæna</em>, which threw him on its back,
and carried him away to Table Mountain,
thinking him a corpse, and consequently
a fair prize. In the mean time,
our drunken musician awoke sufficiently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
sensible to know the danger of his situation,
and to sound the alarm with his
trumpet, which he carried fastened to
his side. The beast, as may be easily
imagined, was not less frightened in its
turn, and ran away.”</p>

<p>Sir Everard Home found that the effect
of the higher notes of the pianoforte
upon the great <em>lion</em> in Exeter ’Change,
was only to excite his attention, which
was very great, as he remained silent
and motionless. But no sooner were the
flat notes sounded, than he sprang up,
attempted to break loose, lashed his tail,
uttered the deepest yells, and seemed so
furious and enraged as to frighten the
ladies.</p>

<p>Franzius says, “the <em>tiger</em> cannot endure
the sound of drums, which maketh
him run mad, and tear himself to
pieces.” Valmont de Bomare saw, at
the fair of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germain, <em>cats</em> turned musicians;
their performance being announced
as the “Mewing Concert.” In
the centre, was an ape beating time;
and some cats were arranged on each
side of him, with music before them on
the stalls. At a signal from the ape,
they regulated their mewing to sad or
lively strains.</p>

<p><em>Seals</em> have a most delicate sense of
hearing, and delight in musical sounds;
a fact not unknown to the ancients. Sir
Walter Scott says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Rude Heiskar’s seals, through surges dark,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Will long pursue the minstrel’s bark.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Laing, in his “Voyage to Spitzbergen,”
states, that a numerous audience
of seals would surround the vessel and
follow it for miles when a violin was
played on deck, as was often the case.</p>

<p>Music has been resorted to as a means
of attracting rats, mice, and other mischievous
animals, from out of their
abodes. In the “Magazine of Natural
History,” it is stated, that the steward
of a ship, infested with rats, used to play
some lively airs on a flute after he had
baited his traps and placed them near
the rat holes. The music, we are told,
attracted the rats, who entered the traps
unconscious of that danger, which, without
this allurement, they would have
instinctively avoided. In this way, it is
said, the steward bagged from fifteen to
twenty rats in about three hours. The
<em>mouse</em> is no less pleased with music. “I
have seen,” says a writer on this subject,
“several mice regularly come out of
their holes and run about a school-room,
whenever the boys were singing psalms.”
An officer, confined in the Bastile, at
Paris, begged to be allowed to play on
his lute, to soften his confinement by its
harmonies. Shortly afterwards, when
playing on the instrument, he was much
astonished to see a number of mice frisking
out of their holes, and many spiders
descending from their webs, and congregating
round him while he continued
the music. Whenever he ceased, they
dispersed; whenever he played again,
they re-appeared. He soon had a far
more numerous, if not a more respectable
audience, amounting in all to about
a hundred mice and spiders.</p>

<p>Sir Everard Home is disposed to think
the elephant does not possess a musical
ear. Suetonius tells us, however, that the
Emperor Domitian had a troop of elephants
disciplined to dance to the sound
of music, and that one of them, which
had been beaten for not having his lesson
perfect, was observed on the following
night to be practising by himself in
a meadow.</p>

<p>The enterprising and lamented Clapperton
informs us, that when he was
departing on a warlike expedition from
lake Muggaby, he had convincing proofs
that the <em>hippopotami</em> are very sensibly
affected by musical sounds, even by such
as are not of the softest kinds. As the
expedition passed along the banks of the
lake at sunrise, these uncouth and stupendous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
animals “followed the drums
of the different chiefs the whole length
of the water, sometimes approaching so
close to the shore that the water they
spouted from their mouths reached the
persons who were passing along the
bank. I counted fifteen at one time
sporting on the surface; and my servant
Columbus shot one of them in the head,
when he gave so loud a roar, while he
buried himself in the lake, that all the
others disappeared in an instant.”</p>

<p><abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Le Cat remarks, that the horse
becomes highly animated at the sound
of a trumpet. Franzius says, “the horse
is very much delighted with any musical
instrument, for he is observed sometimes
even to weep with joy at it, but
most of all he is pleased at the sound of
a trumpet. Pliny, speaking of horses,
mentioneth a sort of people in Italy that
taught their horses to dance to the sound
of a trumpet, which they used to do at
great feasts; and therefore, when the
enemy waged war with them, they had
the best trumpets they could get, by
which the enemy’s horses were so transported
that they would leap and dance,
and run with their masters on their
backs into their enemy’s camp.”</p>

    <div class="verse indent0a">“And when the drum beats briskly in the gale,</div>

    <div class="author"><cite>Rogers’s Pleasures of Memory</cite>, Part <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Shakespeare has taken notice of the
horse’s sensibility to music, in the following
<span class="lock">passage:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent16">“Then I beat my tabor,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At which, like unback’d colts, they prick’d their ears,</div>

    <div class="author"><cite>Tempest</cite>, Act <abbr title="four, Scene">iv. Sce.</abbr> 1.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The instances of the attractive influence
of music on animals are very curious;
but how much more curious is it
to find some animals so sensitive to its
charms as voluntarily to resort to places
where they know they have a chance of
gratifying their taste for it. We are
told, that “an <em>ass</em> at Chartres used to go
to the chateau of Quarville, to hear the
music that was performed there. The
owner of the chateau was a lady, who
had an excellent voice; and whenever
she began to sing, the ass never failed
to draw nearer to the window, and listen
very attentively. Once, when a piece
was performed, which no doubt pleased
him better than any he had ever heard
before, he left his ordinary post, walked
without ceremony into the music room,
and, in order to add to the concert what
he thought was wanting to render it
perfect, began to bray with all his
might.” A writer in the Athenæum,
says, “The ass is no unimportant member
of the Spanish population, for he is
to be seen everywhere; and he has apparently
as much gratification in listening
to the street-concerts as any Christian
present. From the whisking of his short
tail, the steady gaze of his eyes, and,
above all, the pricking of his ears, you
would say that he was familiar with
every tune.” In Heresbatch’s “Foure
Bookes of Husbandrie,” translated by
Barnaby Googe, (1586,) page 125, it is
stated, that asses “are very apt to be
taught, (in Egypt and Barbary,) so as at
this day in Alcayre you shall have them
dance very mannerly, and keep measure
with their musician.”</p>

<p>It is noticed by Franzius, that stags
“love music exceedingly, and are much
delighted in hearing any one sing; and
therefore one goeth before a stag and
singeth to him, while another cometh
behind him and taketh him.” <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Marville
observed that while a man was
playing on a conch shell, a hind lifted
up her large, wide ears, and seemed
very attentive. Mrs. Vasey says, “If a
person happen to whistle, or call at a
distance, the stag stops short, and gazes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
upon the stranger with a kind of silent
admiration; and if he perceives neither
fire-arms nor dogs preparing against
him, he goes slowly forward with apparent
unconcern. He seems delighted
with the sound of the shepherd’s pipe;
which, on that account, is sometimes
used to lure him to destruction.” Playford,
in his “Introduction to Music,”
says, “Travelling some years since, I
met on the road near Royston, a herd
of about twenty bucks, following a bagpipe
and violin, which, while the music
played, went forward; when it ceased,
they all stood still; and in this manner
they were brought out of Yorkshire to
Hampton Court.”</p>

<p>Sir William Jones, in his curious dissertation
on Hindoo music, says, “that
he has been assured by a creditable eye-witness,
that two wild <em>antelopes</em> used
often to come from their woods to the
place where Sirrajuddaulah entertained
himself with concerts, and that they listened
to the strains with an appearance
of pleasure, till the monster, in whose
soul there was no music, shot one of
them, to display his skill in archery.”</p>

<p><em>Sheep</em> have been long noted for their
attachment to music. Heresbatch says,
“A shepherd must deal lovingly and
gently with his flock, comforting and
cheering them with singing and whistling;
for the Arabians (as Alianus writeth,)
doe finde that this kind of cattle
take great delight in music, and that it
doth them as much good as their pasture.”
Franzius speaks to the same
effect: “When the sheep,” says he,
“hear the shepherd’s voice, they all get
together into one place, but especially,
when he singeth, for they love music
exceedingly, and it maketh them feed
the better; they are so delighted with it
that some think they would not live long
if the shepherd did not sing.” This
extraordinary writer also says, “the ox
is exceedingly delighted in music;” and
the remark is true, for fierce bulls have
in several instances been calmed into
gentleness by music.</p>

<p>Of this musical feeling in oxen, Dr.
Southey, in his “Letters from Spain,”
mentions a very singular instance:—“The
carts,” he says, “of Corunna
make so loud and disagreeable a creaking
with their wheels, for want of oil,
that the governor once issued an order
to have them greased; but it was revoked,
on the petition of the carters,
who stated that the oxen liked the sound,
and would not draw without this music.”
Professor Bell, in his “History of Quadrupeds,”
assures us, that he has “often,
when a boy, tried the effect of the flute
on cows and some other animals, and
has always observed that it produced
great apparent enjoyment.”</p>

<p>There is an old song that contains
some lines on the cow’s fondness for
<span class="lock">music:—</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> cold winter evening, three boys
happened to be together, named James,
Ezra, and Stephen. They sat by the
blazing hearth—for I am telling of what
happened in the old-fashioned days, of
broad flues and hickory fuel—without
candles, for the light of the burning logs
was sufficient to give the room a cheerful
aspect. Out of doors the air was
keen and bitter, and though the Moon
shone brightly, the light snow wreaths
were driving on the wind, and occasionally
came in spouts against the windows,
rattling like hail upon the panes.</p>

<p>The boys, naturally enough, talked of
the weather for a time, and then of the
news, and by-and-by of other topics.
At last it was proposed that one of them
should tell a story. The scene can be
best described in the way of dialogue.</p>

<p><i>James.</i> Come, Ezra, you tell us a
story.</p>

<p><i>Ezra.</i> Well, you tell one first.</p>

<p><abbr title="James"><i>J.</i></abbr> O, I’m not good at telling a story.</p>

<p><abbr title="Ezra"><i>E.</i></abbr> What shall I tell about?</p>

<p><abbr title="Stephen"><i>S.</i></abbr> O, anything—tell a ghost story.</p>

<p><abbr title="Ezra"><i>E.</i></abbr> Well, I will tell a ghost story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
There was once a house near New
London, in Connecticut, situated on a
lonely road, about a mile from any other
dwelling. The man who built it was a
farmer; and here he lived, with his wife
and two children, for three years, when
at last they began to hear a bell faintly
ringing at night, apparently in the walls
of the house.</p>

<p>Not much was thought of it at first,
but it was so frequently repeated, that it
began to attract the attention of the family.
They then listened, and every
night, about nine o’clock, it began to
ring. The people were very superstitious,
and soon they were dreadfully
frightened. When they went to the
spot where the mysterious sound seemed
to come from, it appeared to issue
from another place. Sometimes it was
quick and lively, and again it was slow,
and apparently at a distance. At one
time it seemed to be in the parlor, and
then it was in one corner of the kitchen.</p>

<p>The family became more and more
alarmed; when the night set in, they
gathered close together, and as soon as
the ringing began, their faces grew pale,
and they either sat in fearful silence, or
whispered to each other, “there it is!
there it is!”</p>

<p>Thus matters went on for several
months, until at last the farmer and his
family became so miserable that they
sold the place, and removed to another
town. He had not said much about the
cause of his removal, for he feared people
would laugh at him; and besides,
he apprehended that the story might
injure the character of the house, and
thus prevent his selling it at a fair
price.</p>

<p>But, by some means or other, after he
had gone, the story got about, and for
nearly two years the house was unoccupied.
During this period it acquired
the name of the “haunted house,”
which, together with its lonely situation,
rendered it difficult for the person who
had bought it, to find any one willing to
hire it. But at last a person who did
not believe in haunted houses, leased the
place, and with his family went there to
reside.</p>

<p>For about a month they heard nothing
of the awful visiter, and feeling quite
secure against his return, they were accustomed
to make sport of the fears of
their predecessors. While they were
actually cracking their jokes upon the
subject one winter night, about the hour
of nine, there was a sudden tinkling of
a bell, distinctly heard, as if in one of
the rooms above.</p>

<p>There was a sudden start among all
present. “Hark! hark!” was whispered
by several voices. They listened
intently; all was silent as death, when
again the bell was heard, apparently
more distant, but still as distinct as before!
The cheeks of the wife and children
grew pale, and the face of the man
himself was touched with a kind of
awe.</p>

<p>“It is certainly a bell,” said he, “and
no ghost.”</p>

<p>“But who rings it?” replied his wife,
drawing her chair close to his, and shivering
from fear; “who rings it?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell, my dear,” said he,
“but we will try to find out.” Accordingly
he took a candle, and followed
the sound from one room to another.
He heard it distinctly, though faintly,
sometimes near, and sometimes far; but
he could by no means detect the cause.
At last the sound ceased, and the distracted
family went to rest.</p>

<p>The next night the same scene occurred.
At the hour of nine, the frightful
notes issued again, as if from the
very walls of the room, and exciting the
fears of all, still baffled every attempt to
discover the cause. Unlike the former
proprietor, who believed that some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
ghost or spirit caused the bell to ring,
the present occupant rejected such a notion
as absurd; and though a cold, creeping
sensation would sometimes chill his
blood, still he took every opportunity to
endeavor to detect the truth.</p>

<p>While he was one evening sitting
by the fire, the tinkling sound was heard
more distinctly than usual, and instead
of issuing from the wall, undefined and
spirit-like, it seemed now to come distinctly
from a cupboard in one corner of
the room. The man arose, went to the
cupboard, and opened the door. Instantly
a small hand-bell fell from a
crevice in the wall, over the cupboard,
upon the floor. It had a small string
tied to it, and it was now discovered,
that by this string the rats were accustomed
to pull about the bell in their
gambols, thus giving it a tinkling sound,
which seemed to issue from the walls,
giving it the awful and mysterious character,
which had occasioned so much
terror and distress.</p>

<p><abbr title="Ezra"><i>E.</i></abbr> Well, that’s a good story; and it
puts me in mind of one which I heard
Captain Lewis Smith tell. It happened
when he was somewhere in the Jerseys
fighting the revolution, as he calls it. It
seems there was a sergeant Kitely, who,
when he returned to the camp one night,
declared that he had seen a spirit. He
was evidently frightened, for his teeth
chattered as if he was half dead with
cold, and for a long time he could not
muster sufficient courage to tell the story.
At last he was prevailed upon to relate
it, which he did as follows:</p>

<p>“It was a raw, blustering night,” said
he, “when I had occasion to walk down
a lane, to the house of an old woman by
the name of Warlock, who washes for
the regiment. It was dark, and I had
some difficulty in finding the place. At
last I found it, and knocked at the door.
But there was no answer returned. I
lifted the latch, but I could see nobody
in the house. The fire was out,
but in a corner of the room under the
bed were two bright, fiery balls, which
I knew to be the eyes of a cat, but they
seemed to be twice as large as common.</p>

<p>“This made me a little skittish, for I
then happened to remember that the old
beldam herself is reputed a witch; and
I thought to myself, that perhaps after
all, it was she, sitting there under the
bed, rolling up her fiery eyes at me, and
pretending to be a cat. As I thought
this, the eyes seemed to grow bigger and
bigger. I then shut the door, and prepared
to run.</p>

<p>“Just as I was about to start, I saw a
thing as white as the driven snow and
in the shape of an old woman, flying and
flapping in the air, and lifting up her arms,
and seeming to threaten me in the most
awful manner. I tried to run, but my
feet stuck to the ground. I should
have screamed, but my tongue clung to
the roof of my mouth, and my hair rose
up so as <a id="chg1"></a>to throw my hat off my head.</p>

<p>“How I contrived to pick it up
I cannot say, but I heard the footsteps of
some one near, and this I believe gave
me courage. I caught my hat and ran
as fast as my legs would carry me.
A voice called after me, but I felt as light
as a feather, and bounded forward like
a school-boy’s ball, with a sturgeon’s
nose in the centre. It seems to me that
I went two rods at every step, and so I
soon reached the barrack. But if I live
to the age of Methuselah, I shall never
forget the fiery eyeballs of the cat, or
how old dame Warlock leaped up and
down in the heavens, seeming to me as
tall as a steeple.”</p>

<p>This was the substance of Kitely’s
marvellous story. But as soon as it was
told, Captain Smith burst into a loud
laugh. This made the sergeant very
angry, whereupon the captain proceeded
to say that it was he who called after
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
him at the door of old dame Warlock;
and that the ghost he saw was only a
shirt which the old dame had washed
and hung to a clothes-line, and the
night being windy, it was frolicing in
the gale, and jumping up and down, just as
the sergeant had described. This explanation
excited a laugh among the company,
and though it was at the expense
of the sergeant, he seemed really glad to
be thus relieved of his terror.</p>

<p><abbr title="James"><i>J.</i></abbr> Very good—very good indeed,
though I can hardly conceive how any
one could take a piece of linen for an old
woman.</p>

<p><abbr title="Ezra"><i>E.</i></abbr> Why, I suppose it was because
the man’s imagination was excited: he
had, no doubt, a touch of superstition in
him, and this it was that deceived him.
A person who is superstitious—one who
believes in ghosts and witches, and such
things—is very likely to fancy that he
sees them. Such a one is always meeting
with wonders, particularly at night:
a stump, a post, a bush, to his eye, has
arms, legs, eyes and ears; nay, it generally
moves about, and often seems to
do more than mortals are able to perform.</p>

<p><abbr title="Stephen"><i>S.</i></abbr> Then you don’t believe in ghosts?</p>

<p><abbr title="Ezra"><i>E.</i></abbr> Not at all. I believe that all the
ghost stories are either the inventions
of wicked people, or the delusions of indulged
and ill-directed imagination:
fancies of those who have first been led
to adopt false opinions, and have then
become the dupes of these opinions.</p>

<p><abbr title="Stephen"><i>S.</i></abbr> You are quite a philosopher; but
let me tell you a tale of one who was as
incredulous as yourself. There was
once a physician in Connecticut, who
had occasion to stay late at night with
one of his patients. It was past one
o’clock when he mounted his horse to return
home. It was a cold, clear winter’s
night, and the moon shone with uncommon
brilliancy.</p>

<p>The physician had occasion to pass
by a small but lonely grave-yard, situated
at the farther extremity of a field,
near the road. As he was passing by,
he cast his eye toward the grave-yard,
and what was his amazement to see a
figure, as if of a woman, clothed in dazzling
white, proceeding slowly across the
field toward the little group of tombstones.</p>

<p>It was almost as light as day, and
it appeared impossible that the seeming
vision could be an illusion, yet the
physician being an habitual unbeliever
in ghosts and apparitions, conceived for a
moment that his senses must have deceived
him. He passed his hand across
his brow, as if to clear his eye, and
recalled the events of the day, to
discover if he was not dreaming. He
then looked again, and still the image
was there, gliding, as if upon the air,
and with a noiseless step, over the snow
crust, toward the graves.</p>

<p>For a moment the mind of the physician
wavered between a chill, creeping
feeling of awe and superstition, and an
intense desire to know the truth. At
last the latter triumphed; and fastening
his horse to a fence, he proceeded directly
toward the object of his wonder.
It continued to recede from him, but at
last it sat down upon a grave stone, near
a heap of fresh earth, removed for a
tomb.</p>

<p>The physician approached—yet paused
a moment to contemplate the mysterious
figure. It seemed a woman, and
as the clear moonlight fell upon the face,
it appeared cold as marble, though
touched with an indescribable air of melancholy.
With a resolute step he advanced
and laid his hand upon the shoulder
of the figure. It screamed and fell
to the earth.</p>

<p>The physician lifted the form from the
ground, and discovered it to be a woman
whom he knew, and whose child had
died three days before. It had been interred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
in the little burial ground, and in
her sleep the mother had walked across
the snowy fields, wrapped in a sheet, to
visit the spot where her infant reposed!</p>

<p><abbr title="Ezra"><i>E.</i></abbr> So, so, master Stephen, your story
after all but confirms my theory—that
these tales of ghosts are only tales of
illusion.</p>

<p><i>S.</i> True—true; and I agree that
your theory of the matter is right. In
ancient days, there no doubt was such a
thing as witchcraft—but there is nothing
of the kind now; and we may be sure
that he who tells a tale of ghosts, is no
more to be believed than he who tells a
tale of fairies. Fairies and ghosts are,
in fact, as well authenticated, the one
as the other.</p>

The White Bear.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the cold regions of the north there
are a great many wild animals, such as
the reindeer, the musk ox, the silver fox,
and the wolf.</p>

<p>But the most famous of all the savage
creatures in these desolate countries is
the white bear. It has a body as large
as a cow, but its legs are not quite so
long. It lives on the flesh of other animals,
particularly that of whales, seals,
and walruses, which are thrown upon
the shores of the ocean.</p>

<p>In winter, when the ground is covered
with snow, these bears resort to the
sea, and prowl along its borders in search
of food. If the sea is frozen over, they
will venture out on the ice, hoping to
make a breakfast, dinner, or supper upon
the carcass of some great fish, or other
sea animal.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that while the
bear is roaming over the ice, the latter is
suddenly broken up, and the shaggy
monster gets caught upon a floating fragment,
where he sails about for some
days. If he cannot do better, he jumps
into the water and swims to the shore:
but he is very loath to do this.</p>

<p>If one of these white bears meets a
man in his cold country, he will generally
walk away; if, however, he is
very hungry, he will frequently give
him a saucy look, or perhaps even
attack him, and try to eat him up. In
these wild regions men usually carry
guns, and if the bears are uncivil, they
shoot them, as you see in the picture.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
The Story of Hercules.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ancient Greeks, who flourished
two or three thousand years ago, have
left behind them a great many curious,
and a great many useful records. One
remarkable thing in respect to what
remains of their writings, is the mixture
of truth and fable they contain.
Even their histories have as much poetry
as fact, and we are often puzzled to
separate one from the other.</p>

<p>The story of Hercules, one of their
heroes, will serve to illustrate all this.
He is represented as a man of prodigious
strength, and the Greek poets have delighted
to embellish his story with
extravagant fictions. It is said that even
while an infant in his cradle, Juno, the
wife of Jupiter, sent two snakes for the
purpose of killing him. His little brother
was near him at the time, but he
ran away in the greatest terror, while
Hercules caught the snakes in his hands
and instantly squeezed them to death.
I cannot tell you all the marvellous
actions that are attributed to this hero;
a few of the most remarkable will be
sufficient.</p>

<p>It appears that there was a terrible
lion in the country where Hercules lived,
which threw the inhabitants into the
greatest consternation. Hercules determined
to kill him, and accordingly went
to the place which he frequented. He
first assailed him with arrows, but these
being of no avail, he attacked him with
his club.</p>

<p>The lion retreated, and Hercules followed
him to his den. Here the monster
struggled for his life, but our hero
succeeded in getting his arms round his
neck, and by his prodigious strength
choked him to death.</p>

<p>There is a tale told of General Putnam,
a little like this of Hercules and
the lion. The General, it is said, followed
the wolf into his den, and after
looking him in the face, shot him
dead.</p>

<p>It is very probable that, if Putnam had
lived in the early ages of Greece, he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
would have been no less famous than
Hercules. We should, doubtless, have
had many poems recounting his prodigious
feats of strength and courage.</p>

<p>Another exploit of Hercules was the
killing the monster with seven heads,
called the Lernæan hydra. The particular
manners and habits of this beast
are not known to us; but he seems to
have been exceedingly dreaded by the
people of the neighborhood. After some
skirmishes, Hercules came to close quarters
with him, and beat off two or three
of his heads with his club. But what
was his astonishment to perceive that
the heads grew out again as fast as they
were knocked off!</p>

<p>He was a good deal puzzled at this,
as I dare say you would have been in
such a case; but one of his friends,
Jolas, being at hand, Hercules sent him
for a red-hot iron, and directed him to
sear the places over with it as fast as he
beat off the heads. This prevented them
from growing again, and the whole
seven being beaten off, the monster
died.</p>

<p>This will be enough to give you
some idea of the wonderful actions attributed
to Hercules, and which induced
the Greeks, after his death, to worship
him as a hero. At the present day we
reverence men of superior virtue and
wisdom; but in the comparatively barbarous
age of which I have been speaking,
divine honors were rendered to
those whose chief excellence lay in bodily
strength.—<cite>Parley’s Universal Hist.</cite></p>

The Lost Friend.<br>
</h2>

<p>“<span class="smcap">One</span> week ago, there was a little
boy playing here; I wish that I could
see him now. I liked that little boy. I
did not know why I liked him. I see a
great many boys every day, but none
looked so gay and so happy as he did.
They told me he was ill. He cannot be
still ill, for his cheek was soft and fair,
and his step was strong. He was as old
as I am, but not older; and when sometimes
I have been ill, I have very soon
got well again. Perhaps this woman
can tell me where to find him. I am
sure she is kind, for she stayed to give
some money to that old man with white
hair, who walks with a crutch; and she
smiled too, as if she loved to do good.
I will ask her, and she will take me to
him.</p>

<p>“Good woman, will you tell me where
I can find a little boy who played here
last week, with bright hair like gold, and
eyes that looked kind, and seemed to
say that he was happy?”</p>

<p>When little Alice Grey had said this,
the woman, to whom she spoke, led her
by the hand to where an old church
stood; ivy had grown all over its walls,
and round it on every side were graves;
a great, great many. Some of them
had cold white stone over them; others
had only flowers planted round, and
pretty trees grew there, with long
branches bent down, as if they too wept
for the dead. There was a little mound
of earth, that must have been newly
made, for the grass over it was not fresh
or green, but looked as if it had been cut
up with a spade, and there were no
flowers yet round about it.</p>

<p>When the woman came to the grave,
she said, in a low, sad voice, “The little
boy with the bright hair and the happy
eye is laid there to sleep.”</p>

<p>Then Alice wept very much and said,
“Mamma has often told me of this, but
I did not think it would come so very
true;” and she cried a great deal, and
sat down beside the little grave, and
said, “Six days ago I saw him, and now
he has gone away: he will never play
any more; yet, then he looked quite
well and happy. He did not join with
the other boys when they were bad; he
did not even run after the blue butterflies;
he said it might hurt them. Good
little boy! he liked better to gather the
wild flowers that grew about; and now,
perhaps, he is gathering flowers in
God’s own garden, in heaven.” When
the woman saw that Alice was herself a
good child, she sat down by her side,
and took her hand in hers and said,
“Yes, God is good, and he puts it into
our hearts to hope and to think that the
little child is happy in heaven, that we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
may not be too sorry for his having
gone away.</p>

<p>“He never wished to do evil; he
loved everybody and everything that
was good. He was gentle, and was
never heard to speak what was not true;
he was good to the poor, and when he
had nothing else to give them, he gave
them kind words, so that all blessed
him; and God too will bless him, for
he loves those who love him; so that
we should not grieve that he is taken
away, but be happy that he was ready
to go. God calls the strong as well
as the weak; little children as well as
old people; and it may be, that you or
I may soon be laid by the side of the
little child. Shall we pray that by his
side, also, we may see God when we
rise from the grave?”</p>

<p>Then little Alice knelt by her side,
and laid her head on the grave and
prayed; and when they got up, she could
not go again and play in the very spot
where a few days before she had seen
that pretty child at play; so that she
went home, and put her arms round her
mother’s neck, and said, “Mamma,
teach me to be good, for God has taken
a little child like me to the grave,
and, perhaps, he may take me too before
I am ready for heaven, if I do not
from this very day begin to please him
more.”</p>

The Walk.<br>
</h2>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My</span> boy, get your hat, and come
with me. The day is so fine and dry,
that we can walk out. Take hold of
my hand, and let us go and feel the
warm sun.</p>

<p>“We will go and see a poor man, and
take him some food. He is very old
and lame, and has no meat, and no
bread, and no milk. We will give him
some of ours; we can put the milk into
a jug, and take the meat in a plate,
and you shall also take some bread to
him.</p>

<p>“He will be so glad to see us, poor
man! He will say, I thank you; and he
will eat the nice food that we take him.”</p>

<p>“May we take him some soup too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, it will warm him, for he has
got no fire, and he sits in his room, and
is often very cold. He is not able to run
and get warm, for he is lame. We can
take him a book, too, for he can read.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Now we have got to his house. Look,
the poor man has a cat: she often
sits by his side, and curls her tail, and
when he pats her she says, ‘purr,
purr.’”</p>

<p>“Poor puss! I must feed you, too,
and pat your soft back. Do not run
away, I will not hurt you.”</p>

<p>“The good old man is not here; he is
gone out; so we will put down the food
for him and soon come and see him
again.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, mamma, I like so much
to walk with you.”</p>

Sources of History.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">History</span> is a record of past events.
<em>Sacred</em> history is the account that is
given us in the Bible; this furnishes
the only authentic history of the creation
of the world and the things that
immediately happened. It is the only
book that tells us of Adam and Eve; of
Cain and Abel; of the tower of Babel,
and the confusion of tongues; of the
flood of waters; of Noah and his family;
of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob;
of David and Solomon; and generally
of the Jewish nation, and the way of
salvation to man, through a Redeemer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
<em>Profane</em> history means that which is
written by men, in distinction from
sacred history, which is written by the
inspiration of God. Profane history,
when it would tell us of the early ages
of the world, has a great mixture of
fable, and is very uncertain in its representations.
This is the fact with the
history of Greece. It is chiefly furnished
by the poets, who picked up stories
handed down by tradition, and embellished
them with fictions of their own.
Thus they heard marvellous tales about
a man called Jupiter, that lived in remote
ages; and was celebrated alike for
his wisdom, for his extensive possessions,
and the influence he exercised
over the people around him. Well, the
poets began to weave up stories about
Jupiter: one said he did this, another
said he did that. So they went on, each
trying to exceed the other, in some wonderful
tale of this wonderful man.</p>

<p>The people listened eagerly to these
stories; and thus encouraged, the poets
went on composing songs and ballads,
until they had made out Jupiter to be a
god who lived in Mount Olympus, manufacturing
thunder and lightning, ruling
over the land and the sea, controlling
the seasons, swaying mankind, and governing
the whole troop of gods and
goddesses throughout the world. This
is the way the fiction of Jupiter was
devised and executed, and may serve as
a hint at the means by which the whole
mythology of Egypt, Greece and Rome,
was fabricated.</p>

<p>Thus it is that nearly all the earlier
portions of profane history are to be regarded
as doubtful. There are, indeed,
certain portions of it, which may be received
as true; such, for instance, as are
derived from monuments now existing,
and bearing certain inscriptions. There
are in Egypt, in Greece, in various parts
of Asia and Europe, very ancient pyramids,
obelisks, and edifices, bearing inscriptions
or carvings, either of writings or
pictorial representations, which furnish
us with dates, facts, and occurrences
serving to establish epochs, or great
events, thus giving consistency and certainty
to the leading features of history.
It is in this way that the framework of
the more ancient parts of history is
made out and established; and so much
may be deemed worthy of credit. Most
of the details and lesser incidents, such
as the extraordinary feats of individuals,
the extravagant numbers said to be engaged
in particular battles; and, in short,
all the more marvellous portions of ancient
history, are to be deemed entire
fictions, or poetic embellishments and exaggerations.</p>

<p>Among the most interesting of ancient
remains, which contribute to make out
the story of mankind, are the paintings
recently discovered in the chambers of
the ruins of ancient Thebes, in Egypt.
These tell us, without leaving room for
doubt, how the Egyptians dressed themselves;
what they ate and drank; how
they broiled, boiled, and fried; how
they combed their heads and arrayed
their hair; how they slept; how they
amused themselves; what armor they
had in battle; how they fought; how
they worshipped—and, indeed, how
they lived and felt, and thought and
acted. Of these curious and interesting
witnesses, we have given some account
in the earlier portions of Merry’s Museum.</p>

<p>Besides these paintings, the hieroglyphics,
or picture writings of the Egyptians,
graven on obelisks, and other
monuments, afford great aid to the historians.
When Bonaparte went with a
French army to Egypt, he took a great
many learned men with him. These
looked at these hieroglyphics with intense
interest and curiosity, and longed
to find out the means of reading them—for
this art had not then been discovered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
These persons were infidels, and
not believing the Bible, they wished to
be able to prove it untrue. “If we could
read these inscriptions,” said they, as
they stood before the hieroglyphics upon
the monuments of Thebes, “if we could
read these, we could prove the Old Testament
to be false.”</p>

<p>After a few years, a very ingenious
Frenchman, by the name of Champollion,
went to Egypt and studied profoundly
into these mysterious hieroglyphics. At
last he happened to hit upon the art of
reading some of them, and was thus
able to make out their meaning. The
result has been very different from what
the French philosophers supposed; for,
instead of exploding the Scriptures, these
Egyptian writings afford very strong
additional evidence of their truth.</p>

<p>Another satisfactory source of authentic
history, is afforded by the remains of
Greek sculptures, found upon the ancient
temples. Many of these have
been carried to London and deposited in
museums, where they have been very
thoroughly examined, thus furnishing
rich materials for the historian. Other
sculptures, particularly statues, have
been discovered in Greece, which furnish
many interesting facts.</p>

<p>The coins that are found in different
parts of the world, have contributed not
a little to give certainty to portions of
ancient history, particularly that of
Rome. In Europe there are antiquarians
who have devoted whole lives and
ample fortunes to the collecting of coins.
For a scarce coin, even of copper, and
of itself not worth as much as one cent,
hundreds of dollars have often been
paid, merely because it was very rare.
In some of the European collections,
there are complete, or nearly complete,
sets of coins of all the emperors of
Rome; and as these have the likenesses
of the emperors upon them, we
have handed down to us, the image and
superscription of every one of these successors
of the Cæsars.</p>

<p>Besides these sources of history, we
have the writings, either perfect or in
part, of several ancient authors. Among
the Greeks are Aristotle and Plato, who
were philosophers; Homer, the greatest
of poets; Herodotus, Thucydides, and
Xenophon, historians. Among the Egyptians,
Ptolemy, the greatest of the ancient
astronomers, and the father of geography.
Among the Romans, we have
Cornelius Nepos, Cæsar, Livy, and Sallust,
historians; Plutarch, a biographer,
and many others in different branches
of literature.</p>

<p>Rome, in its days of glory, had extended
her conquests over the most civilized
and populous portions of the
world. Indeed, she stretched her authority
on every side, and brought
under her dominion nearly every portion
of the known world. All Europe
was subject to her sway; all Africa,
contiguous to the Mediterranean Sea;
all the middle, western and northern
portions of Asia. Over these vast dominions
her armies marched, and her
messengers passed to and fro. The art of
writing was then extensively practised,
and though printing was unknown, still
the means of communicating and diffusing
exact knowledge were possessed in
all parts of the extended empire. This
period of Roman history, therefore,
abounded in materials for history.</p>

<p>But in the fifth century of the Christian
era, Rome fell, a dismembered edifice,
and its trampled ruins were parcelled
out and possessed by barbarians. Her
arts and her literature were, for a time,
buried in the mighty wreck. It was left
to the priests in the monasteries, during
the dark ages, to delve and dig out these
literary treasures. To them we are indebted
for preserving nearly all that remains.</p>

<p>In 1444, the art of printing was invented;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
the art of multiplying records
and copies of human writings. This is
the art of arts; the triumph of human
skill; the greatest civilizer of society.
In the next number I shall give a
sketch of the discovery and progress of
the art of printing, with a portrait of its
inventor, and attempt to set forth some
of the effects which have resulted from
it.</p>

<h2>
Something about Government.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the earlier numbers of our Museum,
we have told the story of Philip
Brusque, the main purpose of which was
to show the necessity of some government
in society, to ensure peace, order
and justice. Mr. Robinson, of New
York, has just published a book for
schools and families, entitled “The
Young American; or Book of Government
and Law; showing their history,
origin, nature and necessity.” I here
insert two chapters of the work, to show
that all persons are interested in government,
and that all young persons ought
to be instructed on this subject, as one
of the greatest importance.</p>

<h3 class="allsmcap">
THE LAW IS EVERYWHERE.<br>
</h3>

<p>When children are sufficiently advanced,
they go forth from the parental
roof, and whether in the field, the forest,
or the street, they find that everywhere
there is government and law.</p>

<p>If a child sees ripe fruit in a neighbor’s
garden, he sets out to get it, but is immediately
told that he must not. He
asks why he must not get it, and is answered
that it is against the law. A
boy is about to throw down a stone
wall around a field, and is told he must
not, because it is against the law. A
young fellow wishes to ride into a neighbor’s
field of grain, but he must not, for
it is against the law.</p>

<p>A young person, in reading a newspaper,
sees an account of a man who is
seized and hurried away to prison for
theft, and learns that thieving is forbidden
by the law. In another paper
the reader finds an account of some pirates
being hung, because they robbed a
vessel upon the high seas, and this, too,
because such robbery is against the law.</p>

<p>Thus the law is seen to be everywhere,
upon the land and the sea, in town and
country; and the question soon arises,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
who makes the law? The answer to
this is readily given; it is the government?
But what is the government?
Who is it, what is it, that has spread
this net-work of prohibition and requisition
over the land, involving every member
of society in its meshes? Who
administers the government? Who
makes the government? By what
means or instruments does the government
operate? Why do people obey the
government? How does it acquire such
universal and decisive power?</p>

<p>To some or perhaps all of these questions,
which, one after another, arise in
the mind, young persons gradually obtain
answers; but these are usually imperfect
and confused. I propose, therefore,
to proceed to describe government,
its origin, nature, and necessity; its
various forms in different parts of the
world, and especially that form adopted
in our own country.</p>

<p>In the course of this delineation of
government, I shall have occasion to
exhibit the origin and sources of laws;
the manner of their enactment; and the
means by which they are made to regulate
the conduct of mankind.</p>

<h3 class="allsmcap">
EQUALITY.<br>
</h3>

<p>As some persons have fancied that society
could realize a state of absolute liberty,
so some have fancied that a state
of <em>absolute equality</em> could be attained.
It is said in our Declaration of Independence,
that “all mankind are created
equal;” and this has often been taken as
literally true.</p>

<p>But absolute equality is as impossible
as absolute liberty. In the first place,
mankind are not born equal in respect to
civil condition. Some, as the serfs of
Russia, are born slaves; in this country
too, in some of the states, certain individuals
are born to servitude, while others
are born to enjoy freedom.</p>

<p>There are other grounds of inherent
and necessary inequality. One person
is born with a good constitution; another
is sickly from the cradle. One person
is endowed with a strong mind, another
with a weak one. One person is gifted
with beauty, another with deformity.
One has natural grace, another awkwardness.</p>

<p>The surface of the earth, thrown into
hills and valleys, with mountains whose
tops mingle with the clouds, and ravines
that never see the sunlight—meadows
that bloom with flowers, and deserts that
know no living thing—plains and sloping
hills, covered with forests—and rocky
regions where no tree can root itself—all
this diversity of nature presents not more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
inequality than the conditions in which
mankind are born. The whole system of
nature and providence, shows it to be
the design of the Creator and moral
governor, that there shall be diversity
in human society, as well as in nature.</p>

<p>Beside, even in those countries where
there is the greatest freedom, and the
nearest approach to equality in society,
even there, mankind are neither born
free nor equal, in the view of the law.
If we take no account of slaves, still the
children of white persons are not born
free; they are under the control of their
parents till they are twenty-one years
old.</p>

<p>Females, who constitute a part of
mankind, and whose natural rights are
the same as those of men, are never
placed on an equality with men before
the law. They are never permitted,
even in forming the constitution of a
country, nor in enacting the laws, nor
in choosing rulers, to use the right of
voting. They are excluded from all
share in the government, by the stronger
sex, who proceed to make such laws
as they please; and in all countries
these laws exclude woman from political
power.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that mankind
are not born free and equal, in a literal
sense. In what sense, then, can it be
truly said that men are created equal?
Only as meaning that all the members
of society are born with a just claim to
civil liberty—to that freedom which is
compatible with the general good, and
to an equality of rights. It means to
say that those laws which make one man
a lord and another a serf—which make
one a citizen and debar another, in the
same condition, from the right of voting—are
violations of the principles of justice
and the rights of man.</p>

<p>While, therefore, equality of condition
is out of the question, one thing is plain,—that
equal rights, equal laws, and an
equal administration of these laws—so
that the rich and the poor, the high and
the lowly, the citizen and the officeholder,
shall all stand on the same footing—are
the ends and designs of a good
government; and every person should
so use his power as to establish such
ends and designs. Equality does not
mean that a woman shall be equal to a
man, or a child the same as a man; but
that all women, all children, all citizens,
shall enjoy the same relative rights, privileges,
and immunities.</p>

<span class="smcap">A Boy lost.</span> A few years ago, a boy,
who was sent upon some errand on a
cold winter’s night, was overtaken by a
dreadful storm, when the snow fell so
thick, and drifted in such a manner, that
he missed his way, and continued to
wander up and down for several hours,
nearly perished with cold. At midnight,
a gentleman in the neighborhood thought
he heard a sound, but could not imagine
what it was, until, opening his window,
he distinguished a human voice at a
great distance, pronouncing, in a piteous
tone, “Lost! lost! lost!” Humanity
induced the gentleman to send out in
search of the person from whom the
voice proceeded, when, after a long
search, the poor boy was found nearly
benumbed with cold. Happy was it for
him that he knew his danger, that he
cried for help, and that his cry was
heard!</p>

Anecdotes of Storks.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are great numbers of these
birds in the south of Russia. Before
migrating, which they always do at the
approach of winter, they assemble from
all parts, and kill the young ones that
are not strong enough to accompany
them in their long flight. This characteristic
is remarkable, and in strong contrast
to the affection they generally display
towards their young. Of this, the
following anecdote, related to me by a
merchant of my acquaintance, is an example.</p>

<p>He was on his way to Kharkoff, when
he observed, one evening, several peasants
assembled around something in a
field near a village. Ordering the driver
to stop, he alighted from his carriage,
and went up to them to see what was
going on. Arriving at the spot, he found
that they were looking at two dead storks
which were lying on the grass, and upon
his inquiring the reason of their taking
such an interest in these birds, one of
the bystanders gave him the following
singular account.</p>

<p>The storks had a nest in the field they
were then lying in. The hen bird had
been sitting that morning; and the male
left her as usual in search of food. During
his absence, the female, either with
the same intention, or to have a bit of
gossip with some of the other storks in the
neighborhood, also took her departure.
No sooner had she left her nest, than a
species of hawk, very common in the
steppes, seeing the eggs unprotected,
pounced upon them and sucked them.
A short time after this, the male bird returned,
and finding the eggs destroyed,
he threw himself down upon the shells,
and gave way to every demonstration of
grief. The female also returned, but as
soon as he observed her, he ran up, attacked
her with his beak, and seizing
her between his claws, soared up with
her to a great height. He then compressed
his own wings, and both falling
to the ground together, were instantly
killed!—<cite>Capt. Jesse’s Travels.</cite></p>

Artificial Ice for Skating.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most interesting places of
amusement in London is the Colosseum.
This is an immense edifice, which looks,
as you approach it, like a Grecian temple
covered with a vast dome.</p>

<p>The purpose of this building is to exhibit
spectacles and scenes of various
kinds, such as views of famous cities
and interesting places, in all parts of the
world. The effect is produced partly by
painting, and partly by machinery, and
the management of the light that is let
in through the dome. It is scarcely possible
for any person not to be completely
deceived by these exhibitions; they are
so natural, so truthful and life-like, that
the spectator is irresistibly made to feel
that he looks upon a reality and not a
picture.</p>

<p>The spectators—such as desire it—are
taken into a small circular room, which
is prepared with seats; this is so contrived
as to rise slowly, and imperceptibly
to those who are in it, which makes
the scene itself appear to change. By
this contrivance, the effect of sunrise
and evening, upon the landscape, are
produced to admiration.</p>

<p>Sometimes amusing scenes occur
at the place, on account of the circular
room. Not long since a young fellow,
from the country, came with his sweetheart,
to London, and of course they
must go to the Colosseum. In they
went, and the girl, desirous to see the
best of it, pressed forward into the circular
room; John, being left a little behind.
Just at that moment, the circular
room began to rise, but neither the youth
nor the girl noticed it till it had ascended
to the height of ten feet—they were
so absorbed with the spectacle before
them.</p>

<p>At last the girl perceived the ascending
motion—and, looking down, beheld
her lover, far beneath. Filled with the
awful idea of the tricks upon travellers
that she had heard of as practised by the
Londoners, she immediately fancied that
it was a case of kidnapping or abduction,
equal to any in the tales of the Arabian
Nights. Therefore, spreading forth her
beseeching arms, and bending over toward
her lover, in a mingled tone of tenderness
and terror, she exclaimed—“John!
John! John! John!”</p>

<p>The faithful heart of the swain felt
that these sounds could come from no
one but Hannah—his Hannah! He
looked around in amazement; but saw
her not. Yet, as he thought very <em>highly</em>
of her, and deemed her almost an angel,
it was not difficult for him, as the sounds
plainly came from <em>above</em>, to seek her in
that direction. He turned his eyes upward,
and there she was, sure enough,
going it—“John! John! John!”</p>

<p>It is singular how differently terror
affects women from what it does men.
The former are usually rendered more
eloquent by its influence—while the latter
are often reduced to silence. So it
was with our hero now. Deeply impressed
with the wonderful event,—his
fair friend ascending to the skies, while
he stood still upon the earth,—his mind
agonized at the idea of separation, and a
thousand creeping fears rushing through
his heart at the recollection that they
were in that wild wilderness—London—so
dangerous to wandering love-lorn
lasses; thinking and feeling all this, still
John said not a word. Insensible to the
shout of laughter that burst from the
two audiences, the one above and the
one below—he gazed and gazed, and
said nothing. At last, some one who
was standing near, explained the matter
to him, and the ladies above, pacified
Hannah. So this part of the exhibition
was closed.</p>

<p>Among the spectacles of the Colosseum,
there was a very interesting one
representing the scenery of the Alps in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
Switzerland. This exhibited the snow-covered
mountains; the craggy cliffs
topped with the cottages of the Swiss
villagers; the dark and deep ravines,
shadowed with evergreen trees; and the
sparkling rivulets, leaping down the
rocky precipices. By means of machinery,
the figures of men and women were
seen to move, and the ruffling action of
the water, with even its flashing in the
sunlight, was admirably represented.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting and wonderful
exhibition was that which was got
up last summer, consisting of a field of
artificial ice, made of crystal salts, principally
soda; and having not only the
glassy look, but the slippery effect of real
ice. The Skating Club of London were
invited to try it, and they pronounced it
excellent. Accordingly, the exhibition
was opened in mid-summer, and the spectators,
sitting in an atmosphere of eighty
degrees, could be amused with seeing
a party of skaters before them, gliding
about with all the activity and ease attending
such a display in winter. In
order to render the illusion more perfect,
and the scene more picturesque, the surrounding
scenery consisted of snow-capped
hills and mountains, bearing all the
wild and savage aspect of the Alps in
winter. The effect was admirable—the
deception complete. The spectator, in
July or August, coming from a view of
Regent’s Park, decked in all the gorgeous
livery of summer, in the space of
thirty seconds found himself transported
to an Alpine scene in the season of the
sternest winter. Before him was an icy
lake, and skaters were gliding over its
surface; while the distance displayed all
the chill and ghastly features of Switzerland,
in January.</p>

<p>Such a transition was almost a realizing
of the tricks which fancy sometimes
plays us in dreams, and shows us the
admirable power of human art. It shows
us that in a great city, where the people
are cut off from the pleasures of country
life—of pleasant scenery, and fine walks
among the fields—that they still contrive
by their ingenuity, to rival, if not surpass,
the combinations of nature herself.</p>

<h2>
True Stories.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The Duke of Luxemburg.</span> This illustrious
man, on his death-bed, declared
that he would then much rather have
had it to reflect upon “that he had administered
a cup of cold water to a poor
worthy creature in distress, than upon
all the battles in which he had conquered.”
All the sentiments of worldly
grandeur vanish in that unavoidable moment,
which decides the eternal state of
man.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Sabbath-Breaking.</span> A man by the
name of Moore, who was executed for
burglary some years ago, in England,
addressed the spectators in the following
words:—“My friends, you have come
to see me die. I would advise you to
take warning by my fate. The first beginning
of my ruin was Sabbath-breaking;
it led me into bad company, and
from bad company to robbing gardens
and orchards, and finally to house-breaking,
which has brought me to this place.
Many of you are young, and in an especial
manner I warn you to beware of
Sabbath-breaking.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Pride must fall.</span> When Bonaparte
was about to invade Russia, a person
who had endeavored to dissuade him
from his purpose, finding he could not
prevail, quoted to him the proverb,
“L’homme propose, mais Dieu dispose;”—man
proposes, but God disposes; to
which he indignantly replied, “I dispose
as well as propose.” A Christian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
lady, hearing the impious boast, remarked,
“I set that down as the turning point
of Bonaparte’s fortunes. God will not
suffer a creature, thus with impunity, to
usurp his prerogative.” It happened just
as the lady had predicted. Bonaparte’s
invasion of Russia was the commencement
of his fall.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Profanity.</span> The famous Dr. Johnson
never suffered an oath to go unrebuked,
in his presence. When a libertine, but
a man of some note, was once talking
before him, and interlarding his stories
with oaths,—Johnson said, “Sir, all this
swearing will do nothing for our story;
I beg you will not swear.” The narrator
went on swearing; Johnson said, “I
must again entreat you not to swear.”
The gentleman swore again, and Johnson
indignantly quitted the room.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Trust in Providence.</span> An honest,
industrious countryman, in England, had
often been brought, by want of employment,
into very straitened circumstances;
but still he experienced, as he thought,
many interpositions of Providence in his
favor. In conversing once on the subject
of God’s taking care of his people,
the man observed, “It is very easy to
talk of trusting in God with plenty of
provision in the house and money in the
pocket; but I do not call that <em>trust</em>! I
call it <em>ready money</em>.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">A Word in Season.</span> A pious physician
once told a very troublesome patient
that it was absolutely necessary he
should be bled, to which, however, the
man had the strongest objection. Upon
hearing this, he sprang up in his bed,
and exclaimed impatiently, “God bless
my soul.” The doctor said solemnly—“Amen.”
The patient was exceedingly
struck by the word, thus uttered: he became
quiet and said, “Doctor, you have
turned into a prayer, what I meant only
as an exclamation; you may do with me
what you like.” What a striking illustration
of the text, “A word spoken in
due season, how good is it!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">A delicate Rebuke.</span> As the Reverend
Mr. H. was travelling in company
with some gentlemen who had accidentally
joined him on the road, one of them
who was very much given to ridiculing
ministers of the gospel, after he had
proposed several insulting questions, addressed
him thus: “I suppose you are
a preacher, sir.” “I am, sir,” was the
reply. “And pray, sir,” said the scoffer,
in a swelling manner, “what do you
preach to the people?” “Why, sir,” replied
Mr. H., “I sometimes admonish
my hearers to avoid foolish and impertinent
questions.” The company could
not refrain from laughing; they commended
the preacher for his seasonable
reply, and Mr. H. was no more troubled
by his unpleasant companion.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Power of Kindness.</span> A Grecian,
named Arcadius, was constantly railing
against Philip, of Macedon. Venturing
once into the dominions of Philip, the
courtiers suggested to their prince that
he had now an opportunity to punish
Arcadius for his past insults, and to put
it out of his power to repeat them. The
king took their advice, but in a different
way. Instead of seizing the hostile
stranger and putting him to death, he
dismissed him, loaded with courtesies
and kindness.</p>

<p>Some time after Arcadius’s departure
from Macedon, word was brought that
the king’s old enemy had become one
of his warmest friends, and did nothing
but diffuse his praises, wherever he
went. On hearing which, Philip turned
to his courtiers, and asked, with a smile,
“Am not I a better physician than
you?”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
<span class="smcap">Good for Evil.</span> Euclid, a disciple
of Socrates, having offended his brother,
the latter cried out in a rage, “Let me
die, if I am not revenged on you some
time or other.” Euclid replied, “And
let me die if I do not soften you by my
kindness, and make you love me as well
as ever.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Forgiveness.</span> In a school in a town
in Ireland, an instance occurred some
time since, in the master’s accidental absence,
of one boy being provoked to strike
another, which was, of course, considered
a serious ground of complaint. On
hearing the accusation stated, the master
came to the determination of punishing
the culprit; when, to his great surprise,
the injured boy came forward and earnestly
begged for the pardon of the offender.
The inquiry was made, why he
should interfere, or wish to prevent so
just an example. To which he replied,
“I was reading in the New Testament
lately, that Jesus Christ said we must
forgive our enemies; and I forgive him,
and beg he may not be punished for my
sake.” Such a plea, under such circumstances,
and urged too by a child
who manifested a conscientious regard
to the commands of Christ, was too powerful
to be resisted. The offender was,
therefore, pardoned, and it is almost
needless to add, the parents of the boy,
and indeed many others, were highly
delighted at hearing of the interesting
circumstance.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Punctuality is but Honesty.</span> A
committee of eight ladies, in the neighborhood
of London, was appointed to
meet on a certain day at twelve o’clock.
Seven of them were punctual, but the
eighth came hurrying in with many
apologies for being a quarter of an hour
behind the time. It had passed away
without her being aware of its being so
late, &amp;c. A Quaker lady present said,
“Friend, I am not so clear that we
should admit thy apology. It were matter
of regret that thou shouldst have
wasted thine own quarter of an hour;
but here are seven beside thyself, whose
time thou hast also consumed, amounting
in the whole to two hours, and seven
eighths of it was not thine own property.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Calmness.</span> Socrates having received
a blow upon the head, observed, that “it
would be well if people knew when it
was necessary to put on a helmet.” On
another occasion, being attacked with
opprobrious language, he calmly observed
that “that man has not been
taught to speak respectfully.” How
much might Christians learn from this
heathen.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“<span class="smcap">A soft Answer turneth away
Wrath.</span>” A Christian man, who was
hated by one of his neighbors for his
religion, was once attacked by him with
abusive words, at his own door. He
bore for a time the violence of the other’s
language, who called him all the ill
names he could think of. When, at
length, he ceased, being exhausted with
passion; the other meekly, but kindly
and sincerely replied to him, “Will you
come into my house and take some refreshment?”
This was too much. The
enemy was softened—he was overcome
with this Christian conduct, and burst
into tears. This was indeed a triumph.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Linnæus.</span> The celebrated Linnæus
always testified in his conversations,
writings, and actions the greatest sense
of God’s omniscience. He was, indeed,
so strongly impressed with this idea that
he wrote over the door of his library—“Live
innocently; God is present.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Truth hath a quiet Breast.</span>”
When Swift was one day coolly and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
calmly arguing with a gentleman who
had become exceedingly warm in
dispute; one of the company asked him
how he could keep his temper so well—“The
the reason,” replied the dean, “is this—I
have truth on my side.”</p>

<h2>
True Stories of the Young.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Honesty the best Policy.</span> A little
girl was once passing a garden, in which
were some pretty flowers. She wished
much to have some of them; she could
have put her hand between the rails, and
picked some, and perhaps nobody would
have seen her. But she knew this would
be very wicked; it would be stealing. So,
after thinking a little while, she resolved
what she would do. She went to the
mistress of the garden, and asked her
very prettily to give her some of those
nice flowers. The lady told her she had
done right not to take them, and then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
showed her another garden full of plants
and flowers, and gathered her a fine
large nosegay.</p>

<p>Now, if this little girl had taken the
flowers without leave, she would have
been very unhappy; and if her mother
had asked her how she came by them,
she would most likely have told a lie to
hide her first fault. And how uncomfortable
she would have been at night,
when she lay down and prayed to that
great Being who has said, “Thieves
shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Watts when a Child.</span> When
Dr. Watts was very young, and before
he could speak plain, he would say to
his mother, when any money was given
to him, “A book, a book, buy me a book.”
He began to learn Latin at four years of
age. When about seven or eight years
old, his mother desired him to write her
some lines, as was the custom with the
other boys, after the school hours were
over, for which she used to reward them
with a farthing. Isaac obeyed, and presented
her with the following couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">I write not for a farthing, but to try</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If I your farthing writers can outvie.</div>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Obedience.</span> A Polish prince was accustomed
to carry the picture of his father
always in his bosom; and on particular
occasions, he would take it out and say,
“Let me do nothing unbecoming so excellent
a father.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">The Art of Love.</span> Dr. Doddridge
one day asked his little daughter how it
was that everybody loved her. “I do
not know,” said she, “unless it be that I
love everybody.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">A fine Example.</span> Louis, Duke of
Burgundy, was a pattern of filial obedience.
It was never necessary to threaten
or punish him, in order to make him
do his duty. A word, or even a look
was sufficient. He was always much
grieved when his mother seemed displeased
with him, or spoke to him less
kindly than usual. On such occasions,
he would often weep, and say to her,
clasping his little hands, “Dear mamma,
pray do not be angry with me; I will
do what you please.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">a Child’s first Prayer.</span> A venerable
minister in New Hampshire, lodging
at the house of a pious friend, observed
the mother teaching some short prayers
and hymns to her children,—“Madam,”
said he, “your instructions may be of
far more importance than you are aware.
My mother taught me a little hymn
when I was a child, and it is of use to
me to this day; for, I never close my
eyes to rest without first saying,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sound Argument in a Child.</span> A little
boy, upon asking his mother how
many gods there were, was instantly answered
by his younger brother, “Why
one to be sure.” “But how do you
know that?” replied the other. “Because,”
said the little boy, “God fills
every place, so that there is no room for
any other.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Heathen Idols.</span> A mother was once
describing to her little son the idols
which heathen nations worship as gods.
“I suppose, mamma,” said the boy, “that
these heathen do not look up to the same
sun, moon and stars that we do.” “Yes,
my dear, they do.” “Why, then,” said
he, “I wonder that they do not think
there must be a better God than their
idols!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Child rebukes a Man.</span> A little
boy belonging to a Sabbath school in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
London, was taken by his uncle to walk
one Sunday, when the school was over.
The uncle, who was a thoughtless man,
was anxious to buy something for the
child; but little William had been often
told how improper it was to buy or sell
on the Sabbath day. “Come, Billy,”
said his uncle, “I’ll buy you something,
some apples or gingerbread; Aunt Mary’s
not here, and she’ll not know anything
about it.” “Oh, but uncle,” said
the boy, “if Aunt Mary does not see it,
God will, and it’s very wicked.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Why should not a Negro read the
Bible?</span> A few years ago, in the island
of Jamaica, a child, who had been educated
in a Sunday school, happened to
see a negro mending his net upon the
Sabbath day. The child immediately
went up to him and said, “Do you not
know that it is written in the word of
God, ‘Remember to keep holy the Sabbath
day?’” “Now, massa,” replied the
negro, “if you bring de word of God,
and read dat passage, I no mend my net
on Sunday any more.”</p>

<p>The child brought the Bible and read
it; the negro laid aside his net, and going
home to his wife said, “Oh, me nebber
see such picaninny as dat; him tell
me all about de word of God! I nebber
can work upon de Sabbath again.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">A consistent Mother.</span> Some ladies
having met at the house of a friend, the
child of one of them was guilty of rude,
noisy conduct, very improper on all occasions,
and particularly so at a friend’s
house. The mother kindly reproved
her,—“Sarah, you must not do so.”</p>

<p>The child soon forgot the reproof, and
became as noisy as ever. The mother
said firmly, “Sarah, if you do so again,
I will punish you.”</p>

<p>But not long after, Sarah did so again.
When the company were about to separate,
the mother stepped into a neighbor’s
house, intending to return for the
child. During her absence, the thought
of going home recalled to the mind of
Sarah the punishment which her mother
told her she might expect. The recollection
turned her rudeness and thoughtlessness
into sorrow. A young lady
present observing it, and learning the
cause, said, “Never mind, I will ask
your mother not to punish you.” “Oh,”
said Sarah, “that will do no good. <em>My
mother never tells falsehoods!</em>”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Precept and Practice.</span> There is one
thing always to be remembered, by young
people as well as old ones. A person
must not only have <em>good intentions</em>, but
<em>good practice</em>. A person must not only
put his trust in God, but he must do as
God directs. A man who has no faith,
has no good principle of action; a man
who has no good practice, has no faith,
no sound belief, no confidence in Him to
whom he owes every blessing. Good
faith and good works, therefore, always
go together; good principles and good
practice go together. We never find
these two apart. A person never does
right from a wrong motive; a person
never does wrong from a right motive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Pope and his Lady—a Game.</span>
Any number of boys and girls may engage
in this game. It is played with a
small round waiter, or plate, which being
placed in the middle of the room,
one of the little company twirls the waiter
round with her thumb and finger,
making it spin as long as she can, saying,
as she takes it up, “By the leave
of Mr. Pope and his lady.” If the waiter
falls down the wrong side upwards,
the spinner pays a forfeit; and, sometimes,
in the hurry of the moment, she
forgets to say the proper words, in which
case also she pays a forfeit, which forfeits
are afterwards redeemed.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
The Water-Spout.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> water-spout is a strange meteor,
which has attracted a good deal of attention,
but the causes of it are not entirely
ascertained. Dr. Franklin’s opinion
was that a water-spout and a whirlwind
proceed from the same cause; the only
difference being that the latter passes
over the land and the former over the
water. This opinion is generally believed
to be correct. It is supposed that
opposing winds give a whirling motion
to the air, which force up masses of
water, and produce the phenomena to
which we allude.</p>

<p>The engraving represents the appearance
of a water-spout. This usually
resembles an enormous speaking-trumpet
in shape, the mouth end being near
the top of the sea. The wind is commonly
blowing first this way and then
that, causing the spout to bend and
writhe and move from one point to
another. Beneath, where it nearly
touches the water, the sea is agitated
and covered with foam. Wo to the
vessel that is assailed by one of these
meteors! The usual defence at sea, is
to fire a cannon shot into the whirling
tube, which usually dispels it, and the
water falls in a tremendous shower.</p>

<p>Upon land, a water-spout sometimes
commits the most fearful ravages: attended
both by a furious wind and torrents
of water, it often spreads devastation
over the country which it visits. In
1839, a considerable district upon the
Seine, in France, experienced the most
dreadful calamities from a water-spout.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
It uprooted and carried away trees of
the largest size; walls of stone were
overturned; and tiles, roofs and even
houses were carried away.</p>

<h2>
The Elephant and Fox.<br>
</h2>
<h4 class="allsmcap">A FABLE.<br>
</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> sorry to say, that a great many
people listen with more pleasure to a
lively tale that is full of cunning, wit,
and scandal, than to a wise discourse,
which teaches truth and inculcates virtue.
This may be illustrated by the
fable of the elephant and fox.</p>

<p>These two animals fell into a dispute,
as to which had the greatest powers of
persuasion; and, as they could not settle
the matter themselves, it was agreed to
call an assembly of the beasts, and let
them decide it. These were accordingly
summoned, and when the tiger, porcupine,
dog, ox, panther, goat, and the rest
of the quadruped family had all taken
their places, the elephant began his oration.
He discoursed very eloquently,
upon the beauty of truth, justice, and
mercy, and set forth the enormity of
falsehood, cunning, selfishness, and cruelty.
A few of the wiser beasts listened
with interest and approbation; but the
leopard, tiger, porcupine, and a large majority
of the audience, yawned, and showed
that they thought it a very stupid
piece of business.</p>

<p>But when the fox began to tell his
cunning knaveries, they pricked up their
ears, and listened with a lively interest.
As he went on to relate his various adventures,
how he had robbed hen-roosts,
and plundered geese and ducks from the
poultry-yard, and how by various cunning
artifices he had escaped detection,
they manifested the greatest delight.
So the fox went on sneering at the elephant
and all others who loved justice,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
truth, and mercy, and recommending to
his listeners to follow the pleasures of
thievery and plunder. As he closed his
discourse, there was a loud burst of applause,
and on counting noses, the majority
was found to be in favor of the
fox.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The assembly broke up, and some
months passed away, when, as the elephant
was quietly browsing in the woods
one day, he heard a piteous moan at a
little distance. Proceeding to the place
from which the sound came, he there
found the orator fox, caught in a trap,
with both his hinder legs broken, and
sadly mangled. “So,” said the fox
sharply, though he was nearly exhausted
with pain, “you have come to jeer at me,
in my hour of trouble.” “Surely not,”
said the elephant. “I would relieve
your pain if I could, but your legs are
broken, and there is no relief for you,
but in death.” “True,” said the fox,
mournfully, “and I now admit the miserable
folly of those principles which I
have avowed, and the practice which
resulted from them. I have lived a gay
life, though even my gayety has been
sadly shadowed, by perpetual fear of
what has now come upon me. Had I
been satisfied with an honest life and
innocent pleasures, I had not thus come
to a miserable end. Knavery, artifice,
and cunning may be very good topics
with which to delude those who are inclined
to be vicious, but they furnish
miserable rules to live and die by.”—<cite>Parley’s

<h2>
The Vain Search.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> little reader, did you ever get lost
in the woods? Perhaps not; but many
children have. I knew a boy and a
girl, named James and Fanny, who
lived upon the slope of a mountain,
more than a mile from a village.</p>

<p>A large part of the space between
their house and the village, was covered
by forests; but these children were accustomed
to go to school and to church
through the woods, and their parents
never felt any anxiety about them.</p>

<p>One morning, they set out to go to
school; it was August, and the weather
was warm and beautiful. In descending
the mountain, they came to the brow of
a hill, from which they could see a small
blue lake.</p>

<p>This was surrounded by the forest,
and seemed to be at no great distance.
James had often seen it before, and
wished to go to it, but, on the present
occasion, he could not withstand the
temptation to pay it a visit. Accordingly,
he set out, having persuaded
Fanny to accompany him.</p>

<p>They pushed on through the tangled
woods for some time, in the direction of
the lake, and at length supposed they
must be very near to it, but on coming
to a little eminence, and catching a
glimpse of the blue water between
the trees, it still seemed as distant as
before.</p>

<p>They were not discouraged, however,
but again went forward for some time.
At length Fanny said to her brother,
that they had better return and go to
school. James replied, that it was too
late to get to school in season, and he
thought the better way was to make a
holiday of it. They would return home
at the usual time, and their parents
would know nothing about it.</p>

<p>“I don’t like that plan,” said little
Fanny, “for our parents expect us to go
to school, and if we do not go, we disobey
them. Beside, if we spend the day in
play, and say nothing about it, and let
our parents think we have been at
school, we deceive them, and that is as
bad as telling a lie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
“Oh, nonsense!” said James; “we’ll
tell them we got lost, or something of
the kind. Don’t you be afraid. I’ll
manage that matter, so come along.”</p>

<p>Little Fanny went forward, but she
was sad at heart; and James, too, conscious
of disobedience and deception in
his heart, felt unhappy; but he put on a
brave face, and sang, or whistled as he
proceeded.</p>

<p>Again the two children came to such
a position that they could see the little
lake, and, strange to tell, it seemed
about as far off now, as when they first
set out to visit it.</p>

<p>The fact was, they had been deceived;
for the lake was much farther than it
appeared to be. They had already
spent two hours in their attempt to
reach it; and after some consultation,
they concluded to give up their enterprise,
and go back.</p>

<p>But now their task commenced.
They had pursued no beaten path, and
they had nothing to guide them in their
return. The sky, which had been so
clear in the morning, was now over-shadowed
with thick clouds. Uncertain
of the course they ought to pursue,
they still went forward, with trembling
and anxious haste.</p>

<p>Coming at length to the foot of a
cliff, they paused, being overcome with
fatigue. James sat down and buried
his face in his hands.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” said Fanny.
“We have lost our way, and shall never
find our home again,” said James. “We
have lost our way, no doubt,” said Fanny,
“but I hope and trust we shall find
our way out of the woods. This is
come upon us, James, because of our
disobedience.”</p>

<p>“I know it, Fanny,” said James; “but
it was my disobedience, and not yours,
and I am so unhappy because my wickedness
has brought you into trouble;
and beside, I intended to deceive our
parents. I cannot but wonder, now,
that I should have thought of such a
thing.”</p>

<p>“Well, James,” said Fanny, “let this
be a lesson to us both; and now we must
proceed, and try to find our way out of
the wood.” Accordingly, they went forward
with great diligence; but having
rambled about for nearly four hours, supposing
all the time they were going toward
their home, they came back to the
very spot beneath the cliff, where they
had sat down and rested themselves
before.</p>

<p>They were now quite discouraged,
and almost broken-hearted. They had
picked some blue-berries in their rambles,
so that they were not very hungry;
but their fatigue was so great, that, after
lying side by side upon the sloping
bank, for a while, they both went to
sleep.</p>

<p>It was about midnight, when Fanny
awoke. She had been dreaming that
she and her brother had wandered
away, and got lost in the forest; that,
overcome with fatigue, they had thrown
themselves down on the earth at the
foot of a cliff, and fallen asleep, and that
they were awakened from their sleep
by hearing the call of their father, ringing
through the solitude.</p>

<p>It was at this point of her dream, that
Fanny awoke. For a moment she was
bewildered, but soon recollected where
she was. She cast her eye about, and
saw that no shelter was over her, but the
starry canopy of heaven.</p>

<p>She looked around, and could see
nothing but the ragged outline of the
hills against the sky. She listened, and
seemed to feel that the voice heard in her
dream was a reality, and that she should
hear it again. But she now heard only
the solitary chirp of a cricket, and the
mournful shivering of the forest leaves.</p>

<p>She sat some time, almost afraid to
make the slightest noise, yet feeling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
such a sense of desolation that she
thought she must wake up her brother.</p>

<p>She was stretching out her hand for
the purpose of waking him, when she
seemed to hear the call of her father, as
she had heard it in her dream. She
listened intently, her little heart beating
with the utmost anxiety.</p>

<p>She waited for several minutes, when,
full and clear, at no great distance, she
heard her father call, “James?” The
little girl sprang to her feet, and screamed,
with all her might, “Here, here we
are, father!” James was soon awakened,
and, with some difficulty, the father
came down the cliff, and clasped his children
in his arms.</p>

<p>I need not say that this painful adventure
was remembered by James and
Fanny long after they had ceased to be
children; and they were both accustomed
to say, that it was of importance to
them through life, in impressing upon
them the necessity of obedience to parents,
and the wickedness of all attempts
to deceive them.</p>

<p>Let me remark to my youthful readers,
that if pleasure ever tempts them to
forsake the path of duty, I hope they
will remember, that, like the blue lake,
which seemed so beautiful and near to
the eyes of our little wanderers, and
which was yet inaccessible to them, it
will probably disappoint their efforts to
obtain it.—<cite>Parley’s Gift.</cite></p>

<h2>
Varieties.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Juniper.</span> The ancients consecrated
this shrub to their gods. The smoke
of its branches was the incense which in
preference they chose to offer to their
gods, and burnt its berries on funeral
occasions to drive away evil spirits.
The simple villagers of England superstitiously
believe that the perfume of its
berries purifies the air, and protects
them from the malevolence of evil
spirits.</p>

<p>The Chinese delight to decorate their
gardens with this plant. It is commonly
found growing wild on the outskirts of
woods and forests, where it often affords
a safe retreat for the hare when pursued
by the hounds. The strong odor it exhales
is said to defeat the keen scent of
the dog. Its branches, bristling with
thorns, are covered with thousands of
brilliant insects, which seem to imagine
this tree is provided as a protection for
their weakness.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">The Sicilian Vespers.</span> The word
“vespers” in the Romish church means
<em>evening song</em>, answering to evening
prayers. The Sicilian Vespers denote a
famous era in French history, 1282, being
a general massacre of all the French in
the island of Sicily, to which the first
toll that called to vespers was the signal.
The number destroyed was about 8000.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">A tournament</span> is a martial sport or
exercise which the ancient cavaliers
used to perform, to show their bravery
and address. It is derived from the
French word <i lang="fr">tourner</i>, to turn round, because,
to be expert in these exercises,
much agility, both of horse and man, was
necessary. Tournaments made the principal
exercises of the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries; but being at length
productive of mischievous consequences,
the princes of Europe gradually discouraged
and suppressed them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> laurel-leaved Magnolia is a
splendid evergreen tree, rising in its native
country to sixty feet or more, but
with us scarcely exceeding thirty or
forty feet. The leaves grow from eight
inches to one foot long, in form not unlike
those of the common laurel; the
flowers are white, of a large size, and
emit a pleasant fragrance.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
“<span class="smcap">Of</span> what use are all your studying
and your books,” said an honest farmer
to an ingenious artist. “They don’t
make the corn grow, nor produce vegetables
for market. My Sam does more
good with his plough in one month, than
you can do with your books and papers
in one year.”</p>

<p>“What plough does your son use?”
said the artist quietly.</p>

<p>“Why he uses ——’s plough, to be
sure. He can do nothing with any other.
By using this plough, we save half the
labor, and raise three times as much as
we did with the old wooden concern.”</p>

<p>The artist turned over one of his
sheets, and showed the farmer the drawing
of his much-praised plough, saying
with a smile, “I am the inventor of
your favorite plough, and my name <span class="lock">is——.”</span></p>

<p>The astonished farmer shook the artist
heartily by the hand; and invited
him to call at the farm-house, and make
it his home as long as he liked.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Chevalier Bayard was a distinguished
French warrior. He was mortally
wounded in a battle at Marignan.
He ordered his attendant to place him
against a tree, with his face to the enemy.
While in this situation, the constable
of Bourbon, who was fighting against
his country, came up to him and expressed
his regret that his wounds were
mortal. “Do not pity me,” said the
dying Chevalier; “it is not I who am
to be pitied, but you, who are bearing
arms against your king, your country
and your oath.” This brave and good
man died in the year 1524, aged fifty
years.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Superstitions.</span> In the country villages
in England, there are many superstitions.
Thousands believe that the
howling of a dog denotes death; that
pigs can see the wind; to put on your
stocking wrong side out, is a sign of
good luck; and bubbles in your tea tell
that you will be rich; when your cheek
burns, some one is supposed to be talking
of you; when your ears glow, they
are telling falsehoods about you; if your
nose itches, you will be vexed; if your
right eye itches, you will have good
luck; should your left itch, it will be
bad. It is unlucky to meet a person
who squints; if you meet one magpie,
it denotes sorrow; two, brings luck;
three, a wedding; and four, death. To
spill salt is to bring sorrow upon yourself;
and horse shoes are nailed at the
thresholds of doors to keep out the
witch. To lend a friend a knife or
scizzors is to cut friendship.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">The Cicada.</span> This insect, so greatly
praised by the ancients, appears to have
been a kind of grasshopper. “Sweet
prophet of the summer,” says Anacreon,
addressing it, “the muses love thee,
Phœbus himself loves thee, and has
given thee a shrill song;—thou art
wise, earthborn, musical, impassive,
without blood—thou art almost like a
God!” So attached were the Athenians
to these insects, that they used to
fasten golden images of them in their
hair. They were regarded, indeed, by
all as the happiest, as well as the most
innocent of creatures. The sound of
this insect and of the harp were called
by one and the same name. There is a
story among the ancients, of two rival
musicians, who were striving to excel
each other on the harp, when one of
them unfortunately broke a string; a
cicada at that moment flew upon the
instrument, and supplying the place of
the string, secured to him the victory.
A cicada sitting upon a harp, was therefore
the usual emblem of the science of
music among the ancients.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Mr. Merry</span>,—</p>

<p class="p0">Will you be so kind as to tell us, in
your next number of the Museum, what
Imagination is?—and you will oblige</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> be sure I will, with all my heart,
Master James. But first look at the
picture at the head of this article. It
represents a scene in a garden, during
the summer. The trees and shrubs are
covered with leaves: many of the plants
are in bloom, and the little group of children
are gathered around a tuft of pinks,
upon which they are pouring some
water. You look at the picture, and
fancy that you actually see such a scene
as it presents.</p>

<p>And now go to the door, and look
abroad. Behold, it is winter! The
leaves are actually stripped from the
trees; the green grass is withered; the
blossoms are blighted and dead. The
garden is frozen and rough, and not a
flower is there to enliven its sullen
aspect.</p>

<p>The scene thus suggested by the
picture,—that scene in the mind, so
beautiful and bright—so like the joyous,
sweet realities of summer—was but a
sort of dream. That magic power which
painted it, we call Imagination,—or
Fancy. It is a power which can present
the loveliest scenes to the eye of the
mind, and make them seem like truth,
while yet they are only fleeting visions,
passing away as lightly as they came.</p>

<p>Imagination can bring us its flowers,
though it be winter, and all around us is
wrapped in a chill mantle of snow.
Though it be night, imagination can
paint to the mind the fairest and brightest
scenes of day. Though we may be in
Boston, imagination may transport our
thoughts to Rome, or London, or Jerusalem,
or Persia, and for a time we may
seem to be there.</p>

<p>Imagination, then, is like a painter
who sketches unreal scenes so distinctly
as to make them seem like reality.
It is a power so captivating that it often
leads us to act upon what is illusory
and deceptive.</p>

<p>You have heard of persons who walk
in their sleep. They are dreaming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
something, and they go forth, under the
influence of their dream. They fancy
that they see what they do not see, and
are to do what they cannot perform.
These sleepwalkers are persons who are
led away by dreams: and all who
give themselves up to the guidance of
imagination, are like sleepwalkers,—misled
by dreams.</p>

<p>While the imagination is, therefore, a
wonderful power of the mind, and
capable of affording great delight, we
should be careful to keep it within due
bounds. It is a good servant, but a
dangerous master. If we indulge imagination
in picturing what is good, and
beautiful, and virtuous, and happy—we
do that which is at once useful and
pleasing: but if we indulge it in portraying
what is vicious, and vain, and
hurtful, we are likely to be led into
some fatal pit of ruin.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
Burning of the Tower of London.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Tower of London is one of the
greatest curiosities in that famous city.
It stands on the north bank of the river
Thames, in the eastern part of the city.
It consists of several buildings, erected
at various times, all enclosed by a high
wall, on which cannon are mounted.
The wall encloses twelve acres of ground.
The middle building is at once the oldest
and tallest of the group: it is a large
quadrangular structure, with a number of
large rooms, and having a tower at each
corner. This is called the White Tower,
and measures 116 by 96 feet, and is 92
feet high.</p>

<p>Connected with this great building,
are the grand storehouse, ordnance office,
jewel office, and the chapel, beside
many other edifices. In the chapel lie
the remains of many celebrated persons,
who have been executed here or who
died in prison. Among the rest, are
Anne Boleyn, the unfortunate; Katherine
Howard, the guilty; Essex, the brave but
rash favorite of queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The tower of London was begun by
Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, in the thirteenth century,
by the construction of the white tower.
It was designed as a royal palace, and
as such was occupied for a time. In the
time of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>, it had acquired a
horrid celebrity as a state’s prison. Here
many persons have been incarcerated for
years by the government; and it is curious
to remark, that many of those who
have even perished by the axe in this prison,
are now regarded as among the greatest
and best of mankind. In the dungeons
which are beneath the white tower,
it is said that Sir Walter Raleigh wrote
his celebrated history of the world.</p>

<p>The whole of the white tower may be
termed a storehouse, at the present day.
It contains many thousand stand of arms,
all kept in perfect order, and beautifully
arranged; vast military stores, beside a
multitude of papers and documents in
what is called the round office.</p>

<p>The armories in the tower consisted of
three vast collections, viz., the “<i>Horse
Armory</i>,” “<i>Queen Elizabeth Armory</i>,”
and the “<i>Small Arms Armory</i>.” The
two first are collections of ancient armor;
and though chiefly kept as objects of
curiosity, they are exceedingly interesting.
Here are to be seen almost every
kind of armor, from the earliest period
of English history.</p>

<p>The horse armory is kept in a building
erected for the purpose in 1825.
Queen Elizabeth’s armory is kept in an
edifice recently erected for the purpose.
The Small Arms armory was kept in a
splendid building, called the grand storehouse,
begun by James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, and finished
by William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> It was this vast structure
which was burnt to the ground on
the night of <abbr title="October">Oct.</abbr> 30th, 1841. The engraving
represents the building on fire
in the foreground, with the turrets of the
white tower a little in the distance.</p>

<p>This awful conflagration originated
accidentally from an over-heated stovepipe.
It burst forth near the middle of
the night, and from its elevated position
and the vastness of the pyramid of flame,
it wrapped the whole of London in a
glow of light, and aroused its mingled
population with the most intense feeling
of interest. “The tower is on fire! the
tower is on fire!” rung through every
street and lane and archway, sending a
thrill of mingled sublimity and fear to
every heart.</p>

<p>There is probably no one object in
London better known than the tower. It is
associated in every mind with some of the
darkest transactions in English history.
Here the young princes were murdered
by Richard <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> Here Mary of Scotland
was executed. Here, too, every one had
been to see the vast displays of armor;
the trophies won by Wellington, Nelson,
and other heroes, in a thousand battles;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the gorgeous jewels of the crown; the
menagerie, with its lions, tigers, and
other animals of foreign lands. What
must, then, have been the emotions excited,
when the midnight cry, which announced
its destruction, rang through
the city, and when the ruddy light of its
flames gushed in at every window?</p>

<p>When the fire was first discovered, it
appeared as though the whole collection of
buildings must be destroyed: but by great
efforts the flames were checked, and only
the grand storehouse was burnt. This,
however, was reduced to a heap of ashes,
and with it have been destroyed all those
vast stores of arms, and the many triumphant
mementos of England’s prowess
by land and sea, which have so long rendered
it an object of surpassing interest.
It contained, on the ground floor,
a most extraordinary train of artillery.
There were cannon and great engines
of war, of almost every nation, and of
every age, from the time of the invention
of gunpowder down to the present
day. Many of them were associated
with England’s most glorious military
and naval triumphs; others with the
names of her greatest commanders, and
most illustrious sovereigns. They presented
an exhibition as curious to the
engineer as interesting to the patriot, and
such a one as no country but Great
Britain could boast of; but she can boast
of it no longer.</p>

<p>On the first floor was the splendid
room, known as the “Small Armory,”
and one of the grandest apartments in
Europe. It contained, exposed to view,
and in cases, nearly 150,000 stand of
arms. The whole of this building, with
the exception of the bare shell, is in utter
ruins, its contents blended together in
one mass of destruction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sagacity of a Cat.</span> It was only a
few evenings ago that one of our worthy
neighbors, who keeps a shop in Little
Underbank, was much surprised at the
conduct of his cat. He was standing in
his shop, when pussy put her paw on
his trowsers, and endeavored to pull him
towards the cellar, leading out of the
shop. He took no notice at first, but
this she repeated three times; and in
order to see what could be the cause of
her thus troubling him, he took her in
his arms, and carried her into the cellar,
where he kept a large quantity of
leather.</p>

<p>Pussy immediately sprang from him,
and jumping upon a piece of leather, began
to look underneath it, as if in search
of something. Her master raised the
leather, and he there found a boy of
twelve or fourteen years of age concealed
under it. On bringing the young rascal
from his hiding-place, he naturally asked
him what he was doing there. The reply
was, that he had not money to pay
for a lodging, and thought he would stay
there till morning. The worthy shopkeeper
made him remember that a feather
bed was preferable to a leather one, by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
inflicting summary punishment on the
offender. Thus the sagacity of this famous
cat most probably saved the
premises from being robbed, and its master,
perhaps, murdered.—<cite>Stockport paper.</cite></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Coffee.</span> The discovery of coffee, according
to the Oriental writers, took
place towards the close of the thirteenth
century; and, like most other discoveries
of importance, it is attributed to
chance. An Arab chief, the Scheik
Omar, was flying from the pursuit of his
own tribe. Having, with a small body
of his adherents, taken refuge in the
mountainous part of the province of <i>Yemen</i>,
all ordinary means of sustenance
failed them. In his extremity, perceiving
a coffee-bush, the famishing chief
essayed to gnaw the berries; but finding
them too hard for mastication, he hit upon
the expedient of boiling them—drank the
decoction—found himself not only refreshed
but invigorated both in mind
and body; and from him the virtue
of the precious berry afterwards became
famous throughout the world.
But with all its claims to notice, it required
upwards of two hundred years for
coffee to make its way to general appreciation.
Like a prophet in his own village,
it long remained slighted and neglected
by its own native land. Three
centuries elapsed from the date of its
first discovery before the use of coffee, as
a beverage, was generally adopted in the
neighboring state of Egypt and in Turkey;
whilst in Europe, as we all know,
the introduction of the sober berry is,
comparatively of but modern date.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Motion.</span> The common watch, it is
said, beats or ticks 17,160 times an hour.
This is 411,840 a day, 150,424,560 a
year, allowing the year to be 365 days
and six hours. Sometimes watches will
run, with care, 100 years. In this case it
would last to beat 15,042,456,000 times!</p>

<p>The watch is made of hard metal;
but I can tell you of a curious machine,
which is made of something not near
so hard as brass or steel—it is not much
harder than the flesh of your arm—yet
it will beat more than 5000 times an hour,
120,000 times a day, and 43,830,000
times a year. It will sometimes, though
not often, last 100 years; and when it
does, it beats 4,383,600,000 times. One
might think this last machine, soft as it
is, would wear out sooner than the other;
but it does not. I will tell you one thing
more. You have this little machine
about you. You need not feel in your
pocket, for it is not there. It is in your
body, you can feel it beat; it is—your
heart!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anecdote of Lord Kenyon.</span> Soon
after Lord Kenyon was appointed master
of the rolls he was listening very attentively
to a young clerk, who was
reading to him, in the presence of a
number of gentlemen of the long robe,
the conveyance of an estate, and on coming
to the word “enough,” he pronounced
it “<em>enow</em>.” “ Hold! hold!” said his
honor, immediately interrupting him,
“you must <em>stand</em> corrected. Enough
is, according to the vernacular custom,
pronounced ‘<em>enuff</em>’ and so must all other
English words which terminate in
‘ough,’ as, for example, tough, rough,
&amp;c.” The clerk bowed, blushed, and
proceeded for some time; when coming
to the word “<em>plough</em>,” he, with a loud
voice, and penetrating look at his honor,
called it “<em>pluff</em>.” The great lawyer
stroked his chin, and with a smile candidly
said, “Young man, I <em>sit</em> corrected.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carrier Pigeons</span>, A. D. 1099. The
secret of turning to account the peculiar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
instinct of these birds would appear to
have been known and practised in the
east at an early period. Maimbourg, in
his history of the crusades, relates a curious
anecdote on this subject:—“As the
Christian army continued its march, by
the narrow passage which is between the
sea and Mount Carmel, they saw a dove,
which, having escaped from the claws of
a bird of prey, who had let go his hold
at the great noise made by the soldiers,
fell half dead at their feet. There was
found, tied beneath his tail, a small scroll
of paper, in which the emir of Ptolemais
wrote to the emir of Cæsarea, to do all
the harm in his power to the army of
dogs who were about to pass through his
territories, as he, more easily than the
former, could hinder their passage.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Power of Music.</span> Prince Cantimir,
in his account of the transactions of the
Ottomans, relates that Sultan Amurath,
having besieged Bagdad and taken it,
ordered 30,000 Persians to be put to
death, though they had yielded and laid
down their arms. Amongst these unfortunate
victims was a musician, who besought
the executioner to spare him one
moment that he might speak to the emperor.
He appeared before the sultan
and was permitted to give a specimen of
his art. He took up a kind of psaltery,
which resembles a lyre, and has six
sides, and accompanied the sounds of
the instrument with his voice. He sung
the taking of Bagdad and the triumph
of Amurath; its pathetic and exulting
sounds melted even Amurath, who suffered
the musician to proceed, till, overpowered
with harmony, tears of pity
gushed from his eyes, and he revoked
his cruel orders. Influenced by the musician’s
powerful talent, he not only
ordered the lives of the prisoners to be
spared, but restored them to liberty.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Coleridge.</span> Coleridge was very fond
of music, and he has left us an interesting
remark or two upon it:—“An ear
for music,” he observes, “is a very different
thing from a taste for it. I have
no ear whatever; I could not sing an air
to save my life; but I have the intensest
delight in music, and can detect good
from bad. Naldi, a good fellow, remarked
to me once at a concert, that I
did not seem much interested with a
piece of Rossini’s, which had just been
performed. I said, ‘it sounded to me
like nonsense verses;’ but I could
scarcely contain myself when a thing of
Beethoven followed.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Instinct.</span> Smellie mentions a cat,
which, being confined in a room, in order
to meet its mate of the other sex, learnt
of itself to open the latch of a door; and
I knew a pony in the stable here, that
used both to open the latch of the stable,
and raise the lid of the corn-chest—things
which must have been learnt by
himself from his own observation, for no
one is likely to have taught them to him.
Nay, it was only the other day that I observed
one of the horses taken to grass
in a field through which the avenue
runs, open one of the wickets by pressing
down the upright bar of the latch, and
open it exactly as you or I do.—<cite>Lord

Metals.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">That</span> thimble, Henry, which you
are looking at, and think so pretty, is
made of silver. Silver is dug out of the
earth, and so are all metals. There are
a great many metals: I will tell you the
names of some of them, but I cannot tell
you all. Gold is metal; so is silver,
iron, lead, copper, tin, brass, and a great
many more. Some are pure metals, that
is, not mixed together. Gold is considered
the most valuable. Silver is
also valuable; but I think we may consider
iron the most useful; for what
should we do without spades, shovels,
rakes, ploughs, and many other things
which are made of iron?</p>

<p>“We should have no wheat, unless
the earth was ploughed before the seeds
were sown. We could not dig up the
potatoes without a spade; we could
have no fire in our rooms without a
grate; besides, the saucepans are made
of iron, which could not be made of any
other metal. Gold and silver are also
very useful. Spoons made of silver
are pleasanter to use than iron ones
would be. Gold is chiefly used for
money and jewelry, although kings
and many very rich people have their
plate made of gold. Lead is very useful
in building; the tops of houses are
sometimes covered with lead, to prevent
the rain from coming through. Water
pipes are made of it; the point of my
pencil is made of black lead.”</p>

<p>“Is not your ring made of gold,
mamma?”</p>

<p>“Yes, my ring and watch are both
gold.”</p>

<p>“And was that gold found in the
earth?”</p>

<p>“Some gold is dug out of mines, but
not all. Gold is sometimes found
amongst the sand and mud at the bottom
of rivers; it is found in very small
grains, and is collected by the people of
the place with much trouble and care.
There is not much gold found in Europe;
there is more found in America than in
any other part of the globe, although a
good deal is obtained in some of the
rivers of France and Germany. Copper
is more abundant in England than elsewhere,
and there are mines of iron in
most countries.”</p>

The Prussian Exercise; a Game

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this diverting little game, as many
children as wish to play must kneel

hands, cough, and things of that kind.
All the little company must try to obey
the word of command at the same time,
as the real soldier obeys the order of his
captain.</p>

<p>After various amusing manœuvres, the
captain must tell them to “present
arms.” They all then raise their right
arm and hold it straight out before them.
The next order is to “fire.” Here the
corporal, who is in the secret, gives the
little girl next her a sudden push, which
sends her and all the other little people
in the line, tumbling down one over the
other. This is a very diverting game,
and easy to be taught to very young
children.</p>

Anecdotes of Bonaparte.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> the French troops were encamped
at Boulogne, public attention
was much excited by a daring attempt
at escape made by an English sailor.
This person, having escaped from the
depôt, and gained the borders of the sea,
the woods on which served him for concealment,
constructed, with no other instrument
than a knife, a boat, entirely
of the bark of trees. When the weather
was fair, he mounted a tree and looked
out for the English flag; and having at
last observed a British cruiser, he ran to
the shore, with the boat on his back, and
was about to trust himself in his frail
vessel to the waves, when he was pursued,
arrested, and loaded with chains.
Everybody in the army was anxious to
see the boat; and Napoleon, having at
length heard of the affair, sent for the
sailor, and interrogated him. “You
must,” said Napoleon, “have had a great
desire to see your country again, since
you could resolve to trust yourself on the
open sea in so frail a bark: I suppose
you have a sweetheart there.”—“No,”
said the sailor, “but a poor and infirm
mother, whom I was anxious to see.”—“And
you shall see her,” said Napoleon—giving
at the same time orders to set him
at liberty, and bestowing on him a considerable
sum of money for his mother;
observing, that she must be a good mother
who had so good a son.</p>

<p>At the siege of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jean d’Acre, in
Egypt, Bonaparte had three aides-de-camp
(or officers) killed in advancing
with his orders to the same point. It
was necessary to send a fourth. He
had no officers near him but Eugene
Beauharnais and Lavalette. He called
the latter, and, without being overheard
by the former, said to him, <span lang="fr">“Il faut y
aller; je ne veux pas y envoyer cet enfant
et le faire tuer si jeune; sa mere
me l’a confie; vous, vous savez ce que
c’est que la vie.”</span>—Lavalette set off, and,
contrary to every expectation, returned
safe and sound.</p>

<p>During the tour of Napoleon and
Maria Louisa in Holland, in 1810, the
burgomaster of one of the towns which
they visited caused the following inscription
to be posted on the triumphal arch
through which their Imperial Majesties
were to pass:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="fr">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Il n’a pas fait une Sottise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">En epousant Marie-Louise.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Napoleon no sooner read the inscription,
than he inquired for the burgomaster,
and addressed him thus: “So, <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> le
Maire, they cultivate the French muses
in Holland?”—“Sire,” answered the
burgomaster, “I write a few verses.”—“Ah!
you are the author, then,” said
the emperor: “here, do you take snuff?
(presenting a snuff-box surrounded with
diamonds) take this, and</p>

<span class="smcap">Catching Rabbits.</span> Bacon says, “A
company of scholars going to catch conies,
carried one with them, which had not
much wit, and gave in charge that if he
saw any, he should be silent, for fear of
scaring them; but he no sooner espied
a company of rabbits than he cried aloud
‘<i lang="la">Ecce multi cuniculi</i>;’ which he had no
sooner said, but the conies ran to their burrows;
and he being checked by them for
it, answered, ‘Who would have thought
that the rabbits understood Latin?’”</p>

or at the door; but generally
“reclined in blackness” in the room.</p>

Amusements.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the part of discretion to learn
lessons of wisdom wherever we can find
them. In many ways, by looking upon
the processes of nature, we can discover
hints or examples, worthy of imitation,
even by rational beings. As we
are now upon the subject of amusements,
let us see how nature may instruct us in
respect to this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
We look around, and notice that the
young of all animals devote a portion of
every day to amusement. The calf, the
lamb, the puppy, the kitten—all have
their gambols. This proceeds from no
instruction—no parental injunctions; it
is instinct—the mandate of the God who
made them.</p>

<p>We find, in children, precisely the
same instinct—the same mandate. The
desire of active, lively, animating sport—the
romp, the laugh, the shout, the
chase—is as inherent in children, as
much a craving of their nature, as the
desire of food. These are as necessary,
in order to the health, happiness, and
proper development of children, as are
fresh air, or pure water.</p>

<p>Another thing we observe in young
animals, is that their amusements are
suitable to their several conditions. The
wrestling of young dogs is fitting to
creatures who have often to contend for
mastery over other animals; the skipping
of lambs, is calculated to qualify
them to roam over hills, rocks and
precipices; the nimble tricks of kittens
train them for that dexterity
which is needful in their pursuits as
mousers.</p>

<p>Thus far, then, we are instructed, by
observing young animals, that amusements
are necessary, and that these
should be suited to circumstances. And
we may safely apply these observations
to children. They should all have
amusements—cheerful—animating ones.
They should have sports which take
them into the open air—which draw
them over hill and valley—which put
to the stretch their feet, eyes, ears and
hands. All their young faculties should
be roused.</p>

<p>But, hark ye, masters and misses!—don’t
take undue advantage of what I
say—don’t ask for unreasonable or unsuitable
amusements. Of these points,
your parents are the best judges. I say to
parents—your children need their frolics;
I say to children—even in your frolics,
obey your parents. It is said, and truly,
that “all work and no play makes
Jack a dull boy.” It maybe added, that
all play and no work keeps Jack always
a boy.</p>

<p>As to the girls—they need less training
than boys; whether it is that they
are more discreet, or more heedful, or
more docile, I will not say. Boys require
line upon line, precept upon precept—here
a little and there a little—or
rather a good deal. Don’t scowl, my
lads, and think that old Merry is turning
preacher. Not a bit of it—and if I say
that the girls behave better than you do,
surely you have gallantry enough to
bear me out.</p>

<p>But as to the girls—while I would enjoin
suitable amusements—such as are
adapted to their sex—yet I wish to ask
one favor in their behalf, of their parents.
And what do you suppose this may be?
That they may generally spend two hours,
each day of winter, in the open air; and at
least three, of each day, in other seasons.
In this way alone can they ensure enduring
health and enduring beauty.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><a id="v5P66a"></a>
<span class="smcap">Contradiction.</span>—It was said of a certain
Englishman, that so great was his
love of contradiction, that when the hour
of the night and state of the weather were
announced by the watchman beneath his
window, he used to get out of bed and
raise both his casement and his voice to
protest against the accuracy of the statement.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><a id="v5P66b"></a>
<span class="smcap">Bull.</span>—An Irishman remarked to his
companion, on observing a lady pass,
“Pat, did you ever see as thin a woman
as that?” “Thin,” replied the other,
“bathershune, I’ve seen a woman as
thin as two of her.”</p>

All by Themselves.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentle Reader!</span> Did you ever hear
a flock of children—hearty, healthy hoidens—girls
and boys—black eyes and
blue eyes—when all by themselves, in
an attic, or a barn, or a school-room?
Whew, what a racket! But excuse me,
reader, if I ask another question. Was
you ever, of a summer evening, in the
swamp of a southern climate—as that of
Okefonoco in Georgia, or one of those
which border the southern portions of
the Mississippi?</p>

<p>If not—then you have never heard
one of the queerest concerts that can be
listened to. How shall I describe it?
We may pourtray things to the eye by
pictures, but we cannot paint sounds.
To what shall I compare the swamp
serenade of the tropics? Alas, it is
without a parallel. The congregated uproar
of the poultry yard—roosters crowing,
turkeys gobbling, hens <span class="lock">cackling—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Cut-cut-cadaw cut—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lay an egg every day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And have to go barefoot!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">
Geese gobbling; ducks quacking; Guinea
hens yelling; pigs squealing—this, before
I went to Georgia, I thought something—but
it is nothing. Reader, you
may have heard the soft serenade of a
couple of cats beneath your window,
sounding all the louder, because of your
anxiety to get to sleep, and the death-like
stillness around; but this is nothing.</p>

<p>You have heard the shout of a school
set free—the hubbub of a Lowell factory—the
clatter of steamboat paddles—the
rush of some spit-fire engine and
its trains upon a railroad track—the
tearing fire of a militia muster, “all together”—which
means one after another.
All this you may have heard. Nay more—by
an effort of fancy, you may put
them all together, and, worked one into
another by Marmaduke Multiply’s table—crossways,
and up and down—and
yet you have but a faint idea of the
clangor made by the frogs, alligators,
whippoorwills, chuck-will’s-widows, and
other songsters of a southern swamp,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
when they set up for a real serenade—<em>all
by themselves</em>.</p>

<p>We all know that the Italian orchestras
undertake to describe storms, tempests,
and battles—shipwrecks, love and
murder—by music. If one of the opera
companies will go to Okefonoco—listen
to the performances there—and come
back and give us a good imitation, I engage
that they shall make their fortune.</p>

<p>Mr. Southey undertook to tell about
the cataract of Lodore, and he attempted
to convey some notion of the commotion
of the waters by the gushing of his lines,
and he succeeded very well; but how
can any one put the puffing of alligators
into rhyme? Old Homer, I am told, has
imitated frogs in Greek—but the thing
is scarcely possible in English.</p>

<p>After all I have said, gentle reader,
I shall not attempt to describe the songs
of the swamps aforesaid. This I must
leave to yourself. Suppose that you are
in Georgia, or Florida, or Louisiana; suppose
that it is sunset, of a summer evening.
A swampy thicket is before you;
around are gigantic plants, of a thousand
forms, and gaudy flowers of many hues;
gnats, mosquitoes and gallinippers, fill
the air, and sting you at every available
point. Fire-flies begin to glitter.
On every hand, as the darkness falls, the
scene around becomes illuminated with
myriads of these fleeting meteors.</p>

<p>A strange, loud sound bursts suddenly
from a bush at your very ear, exclaiming,
“chuck-will’s-widow!” It is
repeated—slowly at first—and then
more rapidly. Pretty soon another
voice, exclaims, “whippoorwill.” “Confound
us! confound us!” says a croaking
throat in the mud. “Botheration!
botheration!” says one at a distance.
“Thief! thief!” cries another. Then
fifty voices break out, and run into each
other like the notes of a watchman’s
rattle. The din rises higher and
higher. More voices are added to the
chorus, while every one speaks louder
and quicker—and ever and anon, the
deep voice of the alligator is distinctly
heard, betwixt a grunt and guffau—seeming
like the notes of the kettledrum,
or double bass, to this wonderful
concert of birds and reptiles, when
<em>all by themselves</em>!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><a id="v5P68"></a>
<span class="smcap">Profane Swearing.</span>—I believe there
never was a man who made a fortune by
common swearing. It often appears that
men pay for swearing, but it seldom happens
that they are paid for it. It is not
easy to perceive what honor or credit is
connected with it. Does any man receive
promotion because he is a notable
blusterer? Or is any man advanced
to dignity because he is expert at profane
swearing? Never.</p>

<p>Low must be the character which such
impertinence will exalt; high must be
the character which such impertinence
will not degrade. Inexcusable, therefore,
is the vice which has neither reason nor
passion to support it. The drunkard has
his cups; the satirist his revenge; the
ambitious man his preferments; the
miser his gold: but the common swearer
has nothing; he is a fool at large, sells
his soul for nought, and drudges in the
service of the devil, gratis.</p>

<p>Swearing is void of all plea; it is not
the native offspring of the soul, nor interwoven
with the texture of the body, nor,
anyhow, allied to our frame. For, as
Tillotson expresses it, “though some
men pour out oaths as if they were natural,
yet no man was ever born of a
swearing constitution.” But it is a custom,
a low and paltry custom, picked up
by low and paltry spirits who have no
sense of honor, no regard to decency, but
are forced to substitute some rhapsody
of nonsense to supply the vacancy of
good sense. Hence the silliness of the
practice can only be equalled by the silliness
of those who adopt it.—<cite>Lamont.</cite></p>

<h2 class="no-break">
A Roman Story.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the time of the Roman commonwealth,
there lived a noble warrior,
whose name was Caius Marcius. He
was scarcely less remarkable for the
strength and symmetry of his body, than
for the heroic magnanimity of his mind.
From his earliest youth, he had been
trained to feats of war; and his mother,
who was a very noble matron, was
anxious that he should be distinguished
not only for his feats of arms, but for
those other heroic qualities, which make
a man truly great—such as justice,
mercy, truth, honor, integrity, and disinterestedness.
When Caius Marcius
grew up, he soon proved to his mother
that her good lessons had not been
thrown away upon him; for, on occasion
of an assault upon the town of Corioli,
he distinguished himself with such extraordinary
bravery, as to astonish all
those who witnessed his exploits. Having
headed a party which broke through
the gates of the city, he entered it; but
the gates being suddenly shut, Caius
Marcius was left alone within the walls,
surrounded by a host of enemies. Resolving
to sell his life dearly, he made
such an attack upon those within the
walls, that they fled, and he was enabled
to re-open the gates and let in his companions,
who immediately took possession
of the city.</p>

<p>After this brave action, honors and rewards
would have been heaped upon
Caius Marcius, but he refused them all,
with the exception of a horse, the prisoners
he had taken with his own hands,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
and the life of a person in the city, of
whom he had formerly been the guest.
In addition to this, he wished to take the
surname of Coriolanus, as a remembrance
of his victory, which was also
granted him.</p>

<p>Coriolanus from this time signalized
himself in a variety of battles, and always
displayed the same disinterestedness
and magnanimity. As he was
above every mean act himself, he could
not bear to see meanness in others; and
observing the wickedness of the rich, and
the hollow-hearted friendship of the common
people, he despised both, and thus
obtained a character for pride, and made
himself a great many enemies.</p>

<p>But, still, Coriolanus was not without
friends. An old senator, by name
Menenius Agrippa, a very merry old
fellow, was warmly attached to him, and
wished, if possible, to raise him to the
office of consul, which was the highest
dignity the Romans could confer. But at
this time, there was a great scarcity of
bread and food in Rome, and the citizens
were in a state of insurrection. Mobs paraded
the streets, demanding food, and
threatening death to the rich, whom they
supposed had passed edicts to make provisions
dear, that they might drain the
pockets of the people. Menenius met
a tumultuous body of the citizens going to
pull down the house of Caius Marcius,
and to kill him; for they thought that if
they did so, they should get corn at their
own price. Besides this, they wanted
to govern, instead of being governed,
and seemed determined to destroy all
government, by a universal insurrection.
Menenius, to stay them from their purpose,
and to gain a little time, offered, if
they would hear him, to tell a story which
should put the subject of which they
complained in its true light.</p>

<p>After a great deal of tumult, the citizens
agreed to hear what the old man
had to say, who proceeded as follows:
“My friends,” said he, “there was a
time when all the members rebelled
against the stomach, and accused it
of living an idle and luxurious life, in
the midst of the body, without ever
laboring for itself, or taking any trouble
concerning the very things by which it
was fed and comforted. To this the
stomach replied, ‘It is true, I am the
storehouse and shop of the whole body,
but still, I have labor to perform that
you know nothing of; for I have to
convert the rude matters that the hands
and mouth supply me with, into blood,
and to send it in rivers both to the heart
and brain, and every other part of the
system, without which they could not
live, nor could eye and ear, and heart
and hand, see, or hear, or feel!’ Therefore,
so it is with you, my friends; you
feed the governing body of the state, and
this sustains you for all the purposes for
which you live.”</p>

<p>At this moment Coriolanus approached,
and upbraided the citizens with their
many vices, particularly with their disaffection
and cowardice; and advancing
towards them, the determined bearing he
put on, so frightened them, that the more
fearful fell back, and retired to a remote
part of the city. At this moment, a messenger
arrived with intelligence that the
Volsci, a nation which harassed the
Romans, were in arms, and that the city
was in imminent danger. Upon this,
Coriolanus immediately professed his
readiness to head the Roman army
against its enemies, and departed for the
campaign.</p>

<p>Now, the chief enemies that Coriolanus
had in Rome, were two senators,
Junius Brutus and Sicinius Velutus,
who hated him for his proud reserve,
and more especially for his popularity
with the aristocratical portion of the
state of Rome, and as soon as he was
gone, began to plot against him, having
formed a resolution to contrive his downfall
on the first fitting opportunity.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Coriolanus prosecuted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
the war against the enemies of his
country, and came home, as usual, victorious,
preceded by the loudest acclamations
of the people. A triumph was
granted him; and a splendid triumph,
such as Rome had rarely witnessed, was
prepared for him. He was first crowned
with an oaken garland, and then, mounted
on a triumphal car, drawn by eight
splendid horses, richly caparisoned,
through the principal streets of the city
towards the capital. Before him marched
the prisoners he had taken in the war,
and behind him were wagons richly
decorated, and laden with the spoils of
the Volsci. But in the midst of all this
glorious array, Coriolanus beheld his
mother coming towards him, and, descending
from his chariot, ordered a way
to be made for her, and as she approached,
fell down on his knees before her in
the lowest humility, that he might receive
her blessing—a spectacle far more
sublime than those which warriors generally
exhibit to the world.</p>

<p>After this, it was proposed by the
friends of Coriolanus, that he should
stand for the consulship. Now, it was a
custom in Rome that when any one
desired this high office, he should present
himself to the people in the market
place, and solicit their votes; he was
expected to be very humble and very
smooth-tongued, and to ask the office
as a great favor, and to boast of his noble
deeds, and show his wounds, and declare
how uprightly he would act, and how
much he would do for the poor. But
the heart of Coriolanus grew sick when
he thought of this humiliation; and as
Brutus and Sicinius knew his disposition,
they determined that this part of the
ceremony should in no wise be abated,
in order that Coriolanus might be led to
do or say something displeasing to the
people, and thereby incur their dislike.
And this, indeed, was actually the case,
for instead of complimenting the citizens,
he said, “Look at my wounds; see, I
got them in my country’s service, when
some of you ran away from the noise of
your own drums.”</p>

<p>But notwithstanding this haughty
bearing, Coriolanus was elected consul;
for most of the people, although they
did not like to see him so proud, had a
great veneration for his character; and
a great dependence upon him as a warrior.
Brutus and Sicinius, however, determined
to oppose him in the senate,
when his election should be confirmed,
and took the opportunity to influence
the popular mind against him, that
they might the more effectually oppose
him. So when the senate met, Brutus
and Sicinius openly charged him with
showing contempt for the Roman citizens;
while a great crowd collected in
the market-place, who vowed the destruction
of Coriolanus the instant he
appeared among them.</p>

<p>Coriolanus repelled the charges of his
enemies with such warmth and indignation
that they turned upon him, and
being made bold by the shoutings of the
mob outside, called him a traitor, and
wished the officers to come and apprehend
him. He, farther incensed at this
audacity, seized Brutus in his gripe, and
shook him as if he would shake the
bones out of his garment; at the same
time, Sicinius ran out, crying for help, and
brought out a rabble of citizens, who, with
their rude weapons fell upon Coriolanus,
with the determination to seize him, and
drag him to the Tarpeian Rock, a high
hill in Rome, from which malefactors
used to be thrown headlong. “Down
with him, down with him!” was heard
on all sides. But Coriolanus drew his
sword, and in a moment, the rabble fell
back, as if struck by lightning. A great
skirmish now ensued, and Coriolanus
drove before him the ædiles and the tribunes
and their partisans out of the forum,
and passed unmolested to his house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
But the storm was not blown over, for
the tribunes of the people, Brutus and
Sicinius, determined not to give up their
cause till their enemy was destroyed;
and accordingly, used every means an
their power, to incense the citizens still
farther against him. They then summoned
him to answer for his rude conduct
before the people in the forum!
They knew his hot and fiery temper, and
determined, when the day arrived, to say
something that might provoke him, so
that he might, before the whole assembly,
give vent to some expressions as offensive
as those he had formerly used.
Brutus, therefore, when the time arrived,
openly charged Coriolanus with being a
<em>traitor</em> to the people. Upon hearing the
word <em>traitor</em>, the rage of the warrior knew
no bounds, and he upbraided, in the most
vehement terms, both the tribunes, and
uttered the bitterest curses on the people.
This was what Brutus and Sicinius had
aimed at; and therefore, taking advantage
of his passionate indiscretion, they
called upon the people to bear witness of
his contempt, and to join with them in
pronouncing his banishment forever from
Rome.</p>

<p>Coriolanus, wound up to the highest
pitch of anger and indignation, instead
of endeavoring to appease the torrent
that overwhelmed him, turned his back
upon Rome in the most supreme contempt,
after having upbraided the citizens
for their ingratitude and other vices.
He then departed, with the shouts of execration
ringing in his ears. But he had
scarcely left the city when news was
brought that the Volscians, under Tullius
Aufidius, were again in arms, and were
approaching Rome with rapid marches
and in great numbers. Then would the
citizens willingly have called back Coriolanus,
but he was gone.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the banished warrior,
not knowing where to go, and being
without shelter or home, wandered into
the camp of Aufidius, and was at last
brought before the Volscian general.
“Who art thou?” said the chieftain. “I
am,” said he, “Coriolanus, who defeated
thee at Corioli,—hence my surname,
Coriolanus. Fortune hath thrown
me upon thy hearth, and now I am ready
to bow down my neck to thee: and thou
canst, if thou wilt, revenge thy country’s
wrongs, and thine own, by shedding my
blood, and depriving me of the power of
ever more driving thee to thy forests and
thy hills.”</p>

<p>Tullius Aufidius was a man of noble
bearing, and, instead of taking advantage
of the situation of his enemy, offered
him the rights of hospitality. “Come
to my arms,” said he, “and be to me a
brother.” “I will unite with thee,” replied
Coriolanus, “against that hateful
city, which has spurned me forth; and
its ungrateful inhabitants shall perish by
fire and sword.” And upon this compact,
the two generals embraced each
other, and vowed fidelity. They then
took measures of preparation for an attack
on Rome, having determined to
destroy it utterly, and to kill, or sell into
slavery all its inhabitants.</p>

<p>When the Roman people heard of the
approach of the Volsci, they were greatly
frightened; but their terror was increased
when they were informed that
Coriolanus had joined their enemies;
and nothing was heard in Rome but
howlings and lamentations. Brutus and
Sicinius were greatly discomfited, for
the popular fury was turned against
them. They were upbraided for the
banishment of Coriolanus, and were
hooted and pelted by the rabble, in the
same manner as Coriolanus had been; so
that they were forced to hide themselves
from their fury. The former friends of
Coriolanus were rejoiced at this, but they
were no less in consternation; for the
destruction of a city in which we live is
a terrible thing, and must be attended
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
with ruin to all who live in it. They
could not, however, forbear taunting the
guilty citizens with their injustice in
banishing so great a man. The poor
people, who had before exhibited so
much tyranny, now became wofully abject,
and in the most humiliating accents
begged the friends of Coriolanus to go
to him and supplicate for mercy. They
went, but their supplication was vain, for
Coriolanus received them very coldly,
and told them he had taken an oath for
the destruction of the city, which he
would not break, and nothing could
move him from his purpose of revenge.</p>

<p>The city was now encompassed on all
sides by the Volscian array, and the despair
of the inhabitants was complete;
they saw nothing before them but fire
and devastation, havoc and slaughter;
and after having put up prayers to the
gods to avert the dreaded calamity, they
went, at last, to the mother of Coriolanus,
Veturia, and implored her to intercede
with her avenging son. After many
excuses, and bitter reproaches towards
those who had so unworthily treated
Coriolanus, the Roman matron at last
consented to make her way to the Volscian
camp, to obtain the salvation of the
devoted city.</p>

<p>After a solemn fast, and supplication to
the gods, Veturia called to her all the patrician
ladies of Rome, and urged them to
array themselves in deep mourning, and
to wear on their heads every indication
of profound grief. Everything being
arranged, the procession of several hundred
ladies, thus arrayed, descended the
hill upon which the city was built, and
passed through the principal barrier, and
the gigantic gates which led to the Volscian
camp. They passed along without
molestation or opposition into the tent of
Coriolanus, who having received information
of their approach, sat in his chair
of state, fixed, cold, and inflexible, to receive
them.</p>

<p>When the Roman general saw his
mother coming towards him, he could
scarcely refrain from rising at her approach.
He had been, from a child, so
used to honor his parent, that after a
violent struggle with himself, to keep his
fierce and unbending look, he at last
descended from his seat and threw himself
at her feet. “Let me sink in the
earth,” said he, “and as I am an uncommon
man, let me show uncommon
duty to my mother.”</p>

<p>But now there were other suppliants
who clung around Coriolanus—his wife
and his only child. But the moment
they urged a word in favor of Rome,
although done amid the most tender
embraces, he immediately spoke coldly,
and refused again to make any terms
with the base spirits who had cast him
forth and spurned him from the city.
The mother of Coriolanus fell upon her
knees before him; this touched him to
the heart, and he endeavored to raise
her up; but she persisted in kneeling,
declaring that she would not rise from
the earth till satisfied that Rome was
safe from his revenge. His little son
also fell down at his feet, and so did his
wife, Volumnia; the whole of the Roman
ladies also, following the example shown
them, did the same; and poor Coriolanus
soon found himself encompassed by a
host of kneeling women.</p>

<p>“If thou wilt march to assault thy
country,” said Veturia, “thou shalt tread
on her who brought thee into the
world;” while the boy said, “He shall
not tread on me; I will run away till I
am bigger; then I will fight.” This speech
touched Coriolanus very much indeed,
and he could not help catching him up
in his arms and kissing him. Veturia
then said, “Here is thy epitaph, obdurate
man: the man was noble, but with his
last bold deed, he wiped it out, destroyed
his country, and his name remains abhorred
to future ages.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
“O mother, mother!” said Coriolanus,
who felt his determination giving
way; “for you, my mother, for you
alone I yield;” and then, after a severe
struggle with himself, he said, “Rome
shall indeed be saved; but thy son is
lost. All the swords in Italy would not
have made me yield, but I yield to thee,
beloved mother.”</p>

<p>And so Rome was saved from destruction
by the intercession of Veturia; but
Coriolanus, thus overcome, was immediately
upbraided by Aufidius and the
other Volscian generals for selling Rome
and their dear revenge for a few tears.
Coriolanus replied fiercely, and told
Aufidius that he should yet see the day
when he would again make his countrymen
sorry as he did at Corioli; and then
called him a boy. This so aroused the
Volscian general, that he, with his companions,
immediately fell upon Coriolanus,
and slew him on the spot. As soon,
however, as he was dead, Aufidius,—his
passion being over,—remembering his
many great deeds, and his noble spirit,
burst into tears. “I have slain the
noblest heart in all the world,” said he,
and then, as the only recompense he
could make for his rash act, he ordered
the most splendid funeral to be prepared,
and followed it as chief mourner.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
The Rock of Gibraltar.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Gibraltar</span> is a celebrated fortified
rock, at the foot of which is a town of
sixteen thousand inhabitants. The space
occupied by the rock and town, is about
seven miles in circuit. It is almost entirely
surrounded by the Mediterranean
sea, but it is connected with the continent
by a low sandy isthmus.</p>

<p>As seen from a ship, nothing can be
more desolate than the appearance of
Gibraltar, but when you get upon it, you
will find fig trees, orange trees, acacias,
and a profusion of odoriferous plants. You
will also find woodcocks, partridges, teal,
and rabbits in abundance. If you will
wander up the rocks, you will also find
apes of considerable size frisking about,
and seeming quite at home. This is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
the only spot in Europe where any animal
of the monkey kind is found to be a
native. It is fancied that these creatures
pass through caverns under the sea to
Africa, which is some twenty or thirty
miles across at the narrowest part. It
is unnecessary to say that this is impossible.</p>

<p>The rock of Gibraltar is perforated by
a great number of natural caverns. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael’s, on the south-west side, is the
most famous. You enter this about one
thousand feet above the level of the sea.
At a little distance, you come to a spacious
hall, supported by stalactite pillars.
Beneath this is a series of beautiful grottoes,
though difficult of access. It is
said, that in some of these grottoes you
can hear the sea roaring beneath, through
crevices in the rock!</p>

<p>The rock and town of Gibraltar belong
to the English. The former is
strongly fortified, and is considered impregnable.
It came into the hands of the
English in 1704, since which they have
held it, though it has often been attacked
and besieged. The most memorable siege
commenced in 1779, and it did not cease
till February, 1783. The grand attack
took place in September, 1782. Beside
stupendous batteries, mounting two hundred
guns, there was an army of forty
thousand men, led by the celebrated Duc
de Crillon, in the presence of two princes
of the blood. In the bay, lay the combined
fleets of France and Spain. The
assault was dreadful. Four hundred
pieces of artillery, on both sides, were
playing at once. The roar was perpetual,
and the rock shook as if by an
earthquake. Yet the brave garrison
held out, and the attack was unavailing.</p>

<p>The east and north sides of the Rock
of Gibraltar, are by their nature inaccessible.
Toward the south, also, it is
very rocky and precipitous. To the
west, it slopes to the town, and here
the artificial batteries are erected. These
are most formidable. To accommodate
the operations of the garrison, there are
galleries, leading from one point to
another, of sufficient width for cannon
carriages, and cut for nearly three miles
through the very heart of the rock.</p>

<h2>
Order and Disorder.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">A place</span> for everything, and everything
in its place; that is my motto,”
said Miss Steady.</p>

<p>“What stuff!” said Miss Thoughtless.
“What is the use of being so precise and
old-maidish?”</p>

<p>Miss Steady is a very orderly little
girl, and so I must give you an account
of her habits.</p>

<p>She is very remarkable for her neatness,
and for the nice order in which she
keeps her room and her clothes. She
has had a very pretty little chamber all
to herself since she was six years old;
and you may go into it at any time, and
not find anything out of its place. If
you open any of her drawers, you will
find everything laid out smoothly and
sorted. There is a separate place for
her prayer-book, another for her fan;
and, as to her clothes, they are all
doubled and folded in the neatest manner.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock Miss Steady goes to
<em>bed by herself</em>. She folds up all her
clothes very neatly, and puts them in a
chair near the bed, with her shoes and
stockings always laid by her. She puts
all her chairs in order, places all her
lesson-books and playthings carefully in
her closet, undresses her doll, and folds
up her doll’s clothes, and puts her to bed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
After saying her prayers, she lays her
every-day prayer-book and Bible on the
table, where she keeps it.</p>

<p>All this she does by herself; and
when she is ready to get into bed, she
takes good care to place the extinguisher
over her candle.</p>

<p>On Saturday night, she takes her
clean clothes out of her drawer, and puts
them all in their places; and she can go in
the dark, and get anything she may
happen to want. At any time, on any
occasion, she always knows where to lay
her hand on anything. She is also exceedingly
polite.</p>

<p>She never asks questions out of order
at breakfast or dinner-table. She knows
when little girls may speak. She knows
there is a place for her questions; by this
means she never interrupts the conversation
of others.</p>

<p>When she comes home from school,
she always puts away her books, and her
bonnet and shawl, and thus has never
any trouble in hunting for them, as many
persons have.</p>

<p>It is, however, very different with Miss
Thoughtless; for she is so idle, and disorderly,
and negligent, that sometimes
she forgets to clean her teeth in the
morning, and would, I believe, forget to
wash her face sometimes, if she were
not told of it.</p>

<p>Then, as to her playthings, they are
all crammed together; what you would
call higgledy-piggledy, or scattered about
in various places. On one occasion her
dolls were stuffed into the kitchen
drawer, along with greasy dusters, corks,
black-lead, whiting, shoe-brushes, and
hearthstones.</p>

<p>Then, as to her clothes. At night
she slips them off in a bunch, and just
as they came off, so they lie; sometimes on
the floor, or they are thrown on the bed.</p>

<p>Sometimes she leaves the candle
burning after she gets to bed, and on one
occasion, she set her bed-curtains on fire.
</p>

<p>She is continually calling out to Mary;
“Mary, where is my bonnet? Mary,
have you seen my shawl?” Once or
twice in the morning she came down
stairs with only one stocking on, because
she could not find the other. She had
gone to bed with her stockings over her
heels, and one had got wrapped up in
the bed-clothes.</p>

<p>Miss Thoughtless rarely does anything
for herself. She wants Mary, on
all occasions, to pin her tippet, to tie her
shoes, or to put on her India rubbers.
When she proceeds to do anything, she
wants the servants to wait on her.</p>

<p>What a difference between these two
young ladies! If you were to see them,
you might soon tell which was Miss
Thoughtless; because you would see
something disorderly in her looks, something
disorderly in her dress, and something
disorderly in her manner of
speaking.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Wisdom from a Jester.</span>—Bishop Hall
tells us, that there was a certain nobleman
who kept a fool or jester, (a thing
common in former days in the families
of the great,) to whom one day he gave
a staff, with a charge to keep it till he
should meet with one who was a greater
fool than himself. Not many days after,
the nobleman was ill, and near death.
The jester came to see him, and his
lordship said to him, “I must soon leave
you.” “And where are you going?”
asked the fool. “Into another world,”
replied his lordship. “And when will
you come again? within a month?”
“No.” “Within a year?” “No.”
“When then?” “Never?” “Never!”
said the jester; “and what provision hast
thou made for thy entertainment there
where thou goest?” “None at all.”
“No!” said the fool, “none at all!
Here, then, take my staff; for, with all
my folly, I am not guilty of any such
folly as this!”</p>

<h2>
The Old Lady and her Cat.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cats</span> have nine lives, so everybody
says. Certainly, they go through more
disasters than any other animal, and
have more hair-breadth escapes. I have
seen cats fall from the top of a house, and
get up, and run away as if nothing had
happened. That is, you will say, because
they always alight on their feet. Perhaps
there may be something in this;
be that as it may, I am about to relate to
you the adventures of a cat, which are
as wonderful as they are true.</p>

<p>I wish you could have seen her
picture; she seemed as if she were entering
into conversation with her mistress.
And so she did in her way; she
could purr when she was happy, and
mew when she wanted anything. But
more than this, she could show by her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
looks, that she understood a good deal
the old lady said to her.</p>

<p>She was a good old creature, this
old lady, and she loved her cat, because
she had nobody else to love, and her cat
loved her; and well she might, for the
old lady made a pet of her. She fed her
every morning from her own table, with
new roll and new milk; then for dinner
she would have cooked for her a little
kidney, or some other savory morsel.
At tea time, puss used to stand
with her feet on the elbow of the old
lady’s chair, and many a nice bit did
she receive during that meal, with a
saucer of milk before the tea things were
taken away.</p>

<p>Then she had a nice bed. A cushion
stuffed with wool, by day to repose herself
upon, and for night she had a little
wicker basket with a hole to creep in at;
there she curled herself so snugly, that
many a poor creature would have envied
her. In the morning she used to run up
stairs, the moment the servant came
down, and mew at her mistress’s door
till she was let in; and there she would
stop with her till she was dressed, turning
her tail and rubbing against her
mistress’s garments, till she came down
stairs, as much as to say, I am glad to
see you this morning.</p>

<p>But it was not always so with Miss
Puss, I assure you: she had seen many
adventures, and had many escapes.
Few cats had gone through more troubles
than she. I will tell you one of the
events of her life. I think the story will
please you. Well, you must know that
Mogette, for that was her name, was,
what is called a stable-cat; that is, a cat
kept in the stable to look after the
rats, that they might not eat the horses’
corn.</p>

<p>Mogette once had five little kittens;
and pretty little things they were,
and fond enough she was of them.
She thought too, she had secured
them all from danger by hiding them
in a hole in the hay-loft; which she
had lined with hay to make it nice
and warm. She never left her young
ones except she was very hungry; and
then only a few minutes, just to keep
herself from starving. She would then
return, and purr fondly over her kittens,
showing how much she loved them.</p>

<p>There was an ugly, ill-tempered
stable-boy, named Sturt, and a very
cruel boy he was to cats. He was very
fond of dogs, and never so fond of them
as when they turned a cat on its back,
or drew a rat from his hole. His chief
delight was in cat hunting.</p>

<p>He had a fierce little terrier dog,
which he taught to be as cruel as himself.
This dog was always on the
watch for cats.</p>

<p>Poor puss, like a wise cat, had secreted
her kittens in the hay-loft, on
purpose to guard against this dog. But
she often heard him bark in the day, and
felt quite frightened, although she knew
he could not get up into the hay-loft,
still she feared that some day, when her
kittens grew larger, they would come
down and he would tease them.</p>

<p>The dog <i>Snap</i>, for that was his name,
never saw puss but he chased her round
the stable-yard. On one occasion, this
boy, Sturt, set him on, and puss could
not get out of the way till she flew up an
apple tree, and here the dog watched
her, and would not let her come down.
Puss thought of her kittens, and at last
made a desperate plunge at Snap,
scratching his face and eyes most wofully,
and ran with all speed to the
ladder leading to the hay-loft.</p>

<p>Up this she ran, and Snap after her.
When she had mounted three or four of
the steps, she turned round and gave
him such a parting scratch, as tumbled
him off the ladder; while Sturt threw
the curry-comb at her, as she made good
her retreat into the hay-loft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
Nor was this all; for, feeling incensed
at his dog being beaten, Sturt followed
puss, and at last found her hiding-place,
with the five little kittens. “Oh, oh!
marm,” said he, “here are you and
your kittens.” With that, he attempted
to drag the kittens out; but puss flew at
him with the greatest violence, and bit
and scratched his hands till they bled
profusely.</p>

<p>It was a day or two before the fourth
of July, and Sturt had for some time
been preparing squibs and crackers for
that well known day. It occurred to
him that the best way to dislodge the
old cat would be to treat her to a squib
or two: “for that will bring her out,”
he said to himself, “if anything will.”</p>

<p>Full of this notion he hastened down
stairs, and groped his hand to the bottom
of the oat-bin, where he had his
combustibles, for fear of being found;
and, procuring a light, he took one of
the largest “double-bangers” he could
find, and ascended quietly into the hay-loft.</p>

<p>He crept cautiously to pussy’s hole, and
having lit the end of the squib, placed the
thick part so that it would rush into the
hole as soon as it took fire, and retreated to
the corner of the hay-loft to see the sport.</p>

<p>Presently the squib ignited, and just
as he had supposed, darted into the cat’s
hole. But puss never came out, and in
a moment <em>the whole of the hay-loft was
on fire</em>!</p>

<p>Sturt hastened to run down the ladder;
but in his hurry and alarm, missed
his step, and put his leg through a hole
in the floor of the loft. Before he could
extricate himself, the flames were all
blazing around him. He called as loud
as he could, but all to no purpose. He
made, however, towards the outside door—at
last he reached it; but he was all
of a blaze. He leaped down into the
stable-yard, half roasted, and in the fall
broke his leg.
</p>

<p>As to puss, after the squib exploded,
she endeavored to get off; but she could
not leave her kittens. First she took one
up in her mouth, and then the other;
then she tried to take two at once. Oh!
if you had seen this poor cat’s affection
for her young, how much better you
would have thought her, than that
wicked boy.</p>

<p>At last, however, poor puss darted off
with one of her kittens. She was in a
terrible fright, you will believe. She ran
up a wooden waterspout, leading in a slanting
direction to an adjoining shed, with
the kitten in her mouth. She then bore it
over the gable end of a house, till she
got into a gutter on the other side; along
this she travelled, and again mounted
another roof; on the top of this she
walked, still carrying her kitten in her
mouth, till at last she came to a cow-house
and hay-stack at the other side of
the farm. Into this hay-stack she leaped,
bearing her offspring with her in
safety.</p>

<p>Poor puss returned for her other kittens;
but alas! when she got back,
nothing was to be seen but a quantity of
red and black rafters, and vast masses
of burnt hay. The poor kittens had
perished in the flames.</p>

A Sliding Party:<br>
</h2>
<h3 class="ls allsmcap">
A MOTHER’S STORY.<br>
</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was one of the finest evenings in
January; I can remember it very well.
I was then a young girl, and was delighted
with such beautiful evenings as
the one I am going to tell you about.
The moon shone bright, the stars glittered
like so many gems in the sky; not a dark
cloud was to be seen; there was not a
breath of wind, not so much as to shake
the tops of the smallest trees. True it was
very cold, and the snow laid deep on the
ground; and though most of the busy
world had retired to their houses, to
enjoy a long evening by their wintry
fireside, I was tempted to take a stroll
out to admire the beautiful prospect. I
did not remain out long, as it was the
practice of my father to relate stories to
amuse us in the evening, while mother
and myself sat at work. When I returned
home, I found them all seated
round the blazing fire, ready; and all
seemed happy but my eldest brother
John; he was evidently uneasy, and
could not sit still long together, and kept
looking about and listening, and often
going to the window.</p>

<p>At last, he told his father that his
playmates were going on the river to
slide, and that he should like to go. We
all begged him not to think of going out
on the ice, and told him it would be better
for him to stay at home and hear father’s
stories; but all to no purpose; he had
made up his mind to go, though he
knew how unhappy we should all be
while he was away. He promised to be
home at nine, and said he would not go
near the bridge; for there the current
was more rapid, and of course they
would not be safe; and his father cautioned
him of the openings in the ice,
and that he might be liable to fall in and
get drowned. John heard all that his
father said; but boys love to roam and
are fond of adventure; and, I am sorry
to say, that, when they set their hearts
on anything, it often happens that the
advice of parents is of no use to them;
and so it was in this case. He had just
turned the corner of the house, when he
heard the merry shout and laugh of the
party; and he waited till they came up,
and they all went towards the river.
They had a mile to walk, but that was
nothing to a set of crazy-headed, self-willed
boys; they soon got there, and
were busily engaged in their sport.</p>

<p>It was indeed, very fine sliding; and
they staid till the clock struck nine, when
John proposed to go home; but the rest
insisted on staying a <em>little</em> longer, “only
a few minutes,” as they said. John had
many unpleasant feelings about stopping
after the clock had struck nine, for he
knew that his father would expect him
agreeably to his promise; but he at length
yielded to the entreaties of the rest, and
tried not to think of the uneasiness his
absence would cause at home.</p>

<p>From the time John went, we were all
unhappy, and kept asking father if he
were not afraid that he would get
drowned? So much were we all concerned
about our brother, that it made
the tears steal silently down our father’s
face, and he resolved that in future he
would spare us all this anxiety, by using
his authority to keep him at home.
After the clock had stuck nine, and John
did not return, we became impatient,
especially our little sisters, who ought to
have been in bed long before that time,
but they were unwilling to go until they
saw their brother return; and father did
not compel them, for he was the kindest
of fathers, and sometimes a little too indulgent.
But when the clock struck ten,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
the pain of the whole family was extreme.
Father would have gone after
him to have seen if anything had happened,
but he was lame with the gout,
and could hardly walk across the room;
and we had nobody to send. Oh! what
a wretched half hour we spent!</p>

<p>There lived at the public tavern a
man whom they called Sailor Jem; he
had once been a sailor, and he happened
to see the party set off for the river.
While he was sitting telling stories and
hearing the news, a man came in to
warm his feet, and Jem asked him what
news he had. “A sad accident,” said
he, “has just happened at the bridge;
a party of boys were sliding, and one of
them is drowned.” Jem heard no more,
but came breathless to my father’s. He
found us already in trouble, but his story
made us half distracted. My father was
more composed, and begged of Jem to
go directly to the river, or the road
which he saw John take, and see if he
could make any discoveries.</p>

<p>Jem started immediately; he had only
got a quarter of a mile, when he met the
boys returning, all safe. So he accompanied
John, and saw him restored to
his anxious family. Our joy was
great when we saw him safe, and father
did not interrupt it that night, by talking
to my brother about his conduct; but
the next morning, at breakfast, he endeavored
to show him wherein he had
done wrong. They had not been to
the bridge, it was true, but then he did
not come home at the appointed time.</p>

<p>You will see by this, how much you
can do, if you choose, to make a whole
family unhappy, by not taking the advice
of those whose age and experience
enable them to judge better for you, than
you can for yourselves. And remember
one thing, that promises should be held
sacred. Had he come at nine, as he
ought to have done, he would have
saved us an hour and a half of the most
intense suffering; and I hope, if you
make a promise, even the most trifling,
that you will keep it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><a id="v5P82a"></a><span class="smcap">A Roman Judge.</span>—While Octavius
Cæsar was at Samos, after the famous
battle of Actium, which made him master
of the then known world, he held a council,
to examine the prisoners who had been
of Anthony’s party. Among the rest,
there was brought before him a man
named Metellus, oppressed with age and
infirmities, disfigured by a long beard and
a neglected head of hair, but especially
by his clothes, which, through adversity,
had become ragged. The son of this
Metellus was one of the judges, and
had great difficulty to recognise his father
in the deplorable condition in which he
now saw him. At length, however, recollecting
his features, instead of being
ashamed of his unhappy parent, he ran
with tears to embrace him. Then, returning
to the tribunal, “Cæsar,” said
he, “my father has been your enemy,
and I your officer; he deserves to be
punished, and I to be rewarded. The
favor I ask of you, is, that you would
save him on my account, or order me to
be put to death with him.” All the
judges were touched with compassion at
the affecting scene. Octavius himself
relented, and granted to old Metellus his
life and liberty.</p>

<p><a id="v5P82b"></a><span class="smcap">Patrick Henry.</span>—This eminent
American left in his will the following
important passage:</p>

<p>I have now disposed of all my property
to my family; there is one thing more I
wish I could leave them, and that is, the
Christian religion. If they had that, and
I had not given them one shilling, they
would be rich; and if they had not that,
and I had given them all the world, they
would be poor.</p>

<span class="smcap">A Fisherman’s Widow.</span>—One of the
small islands in Boston Bay was inhabited
by a single poor family. The
father was taken suddenly ill, and there
was no physician at hand. The wife,
on whom every labor for the household
devolved, was unwearied in her care for
her suffering husband. Every remedy
in her power to procure was administered,
but the disease was acute, and he
died. Seven young children mourned
around the lifeless corpse. They were
the sole beings upon that desolate spot.
Did the mother indulge the grief of her
spirit and sit down in despair? No.
She entered upon the arduous and
sacred duties of her station. She felt
that there was no hand to assist her in
burying her dead. Providing as far as
possible for the comfort of her little ones,
she put her babe into the arms of the
oldest, and charged the two next in age
to watch the corpse of their father. She
unmoored her husband’s fishing-boat,
which but two days before he had guided
over the seas to obtain food for his
family. She dared not yield to those
tender recollections, which might have
unnerved her arm. The nearest island
was at the distance of three miles.
Strong winds lashed the waters to foam.
Over the rough billows that wearied
and sorrowful woman rowed and was
preserved. She reached the next island
and obtained necessary aid. With such
energy did her duty to her desolate
babes inspire her, that the voyage which
depended upon her individual effort,
was performed in a shorter time than
the returning one, when the oars were
managed by two men who went to assist
in the last offices of the dead.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
The Zebu, or Indian Ox.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most common of the Indian
breeds of the ox kind, is the zebu, a
humped variety, the smallest specimens
of which are not bigger than a full-grown
mastiff, while others are found almost as
large as the finest of our English cows.
The zebu has been considered by
naturalists as not a distinct species, but
only a degenerate kind of bison, diminished
in size by scantiness of food, which
has a decided effect upon the bulk of all
horned cattle. We see that the horse
dwindles into a pony in the Shetland
Isles, and why not the ox shrink into a
zebu?</p>

<p>The zebu, like the bison, is extremely
gentle when tamed, and very
useful to mankind, both as affording
food and serving for a beast of draught
or burden. These animals are employed
in pairs to draw a two-wheeled vehicle,
called <em>gadee</em>, which holds but one person,
and is used by the wealthy Hindoos.
When destined for this purpose, their
horns, when young, are bent so as to
grow nearly upright, inclining backwards
a little toward the top. They are often
covered with rich carpets; adorned with
rings and chains of gold and other
metal, and their legs and chests painted
with various colors. The women of the
lower classes, in India, frequently travel
on bullocks, which they ride astride
upon a very large saddle. The animals
have bells hung round their necks, and
are guided by means of a cord passed
through the nostrils.</p>

The Bison, or American Buffalo.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> there has lately been an exhibition
of a number of bisons through New
England, and as no doubt many of our
readers have seen them, we think it will
amuse them, particularly, to learn something
about the manners, habits and
nature of these creatures. We hope, too,
that all others who may look into our
pages, may find it agreeable to read a
description of such extraordinary animals.</p>

<p>The bison is very different from the
European buffalo,—the latter having
very long, spreading horns. The buffalo
is also a more fierce and daring animal.
Our bison is as large as the largest ox,
and roams in vast herds over the prairies of
the west. Sometimes several thousand
are seen in a flock, and as they proceed,
fighting, lowing, leaping, and tearing the
earth with their horns, the noise is terrific.
The earth at such a time seems
to tremble as if shaken by an earthquake.
The bison is not now found east of the
Mississippi, though it probably inhabited
in former times, the whole country to
the shores of the Atlantic. It bears considerable
resemblance to the German
Aurochs. Its horns are short, and it has
a prodigious hump over the shoulders.
The head, shoulders, and upper parts
are covered with long, brownish, woolly
hair. The tail is tufted with black.</p>

<p>These animals, while feeding, scatter
themselves over the country, but when
moving, they form a dense column, which,
once in motion, is scarcely to be impeded.
Their line of march is seldom
interrupted, even by considerable rivers,
across which they swim, without fear or
hesitation, in the order in which they
traverse the plains. They constantly
wander about, either from being disturbed
by the hunters, or in search of food.
They are very fond of the soft and
tender grass, which springs up after a fire
has spread over the prairie. In winter
they scrape away the snow, to reach the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
grass. They are timid and fly from
man, but when wounded, they become
desperate and dangerous. The
Indians make incessant war upon them
for their flesh and skins. Their favorite
method of attack, is to ride up to the
fattest of the herd on horseback, and
shoot them. Sometimes they drive them
over precipices, by which they are
killed. They also take them in enclosures
made of sticks, about a hundred
yards in diameter. The herds are
attended by packs of wolves, ready to
fall upon the sick and wounded. Travellers
describe the noise made by the
bellowing, the trampling, and galloping
of a large herd of bisons, as impressing
the mind with an emotion amounting to
terror. The bison was the only native
animal of the ox kind found by the first
settlers in America.</p>

<span class="smcap">Anecdote.</span>—In a town of western
Virginia, a few years ago, an old lady
from the country went to a store to procure
a few articles. She purchased
several of the clerk, and at length, observing
a neatly painted and varnished
bellows hanging by the post, she inquired
what it was. The clerk, perceiving
that the old lady was rather
ignorant, and being something of a wag,
informed her that it was a new-fashioned
fan, which he had lately received from
the east; at the same time taking the
bellows down and puffing with it in his
face, told her that was the mode of operation.
The old woman repeated the
operation on herself, and was so delighted
with the new fan, that she purchased it
forthwith and departed.</p>

<p>On the next day, the minister had an
appointment to preach at a neighboring
school-house in the country. The congregation
being assembled, while the
minister was in the act of reading the
first hymn, who should pop in but the
old lady with her new-fashioned fan, and
having taken her seat, immediately commenced
puffing away in good earnest!
The congregation knew not what to make
of it—some smiled, and some looked astonished;
but the ludicrous prevailed over
everything else, and to such an extent,
that the minister himself was obliged to
stop reading, and hand the book to his
brother in the desk. After the usual
preliminary services, he rose to preach,
but there sat the lady with the bellows, and
a hand hold of each handle, the nose
turned up towards her face, and with
much self-complacency puffing the gentle
breeze in her face. What to do, or how
to proceed, he knew not, for he could
not cast his eyes over the congregation
without meeting with the old lady. At
length, summoning resolution, and trying
to feel the solemnity of the duty imposed
on him, he proceeded. He finished his
discourse, but it cost him more effort
than any sermon before or since.—<cite>Mt.

<span class="smcap">A Pious Mother.</span>—It is said, that, in
the hand of one of the mummies found in
a pyramid, was discovered a bulbous root,
which being placed in the earth, grew
and bloomed a beautiful but unknown
flower, after having been buried for
many hundred years. So may the good
seed of God spring up after many years.
We mention a case in point. Some
years since, a venerable old man, upwards
of one hundred years old, was the
subject of converting grace in an American
state. The cause of his conversion
was hearing a text of Scripture, which
his pious mother had taught him in England,
one hundred years before!</p>

<h2>
The Story of Limping Tom.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> will, perhaps, be surprised to
hear that Limping Tom had two as good
legs as were ever seen. Why then did
he limp? That is a natural question,
and I shall proceed to answer it.</p>

<p>Tom was not a boy—but a cat! He
was born and brought up in a barn.
One day, when he and his little brothers
and sisters were frolicking over the barn
floor, all alone, a little snappish dog
peeped in and saw what was going on.</p>

<p>In he came, and began to chase the
kittens. They were awfully frightened,
and scampered in all directions. Some
dove into a hole in the floor—one hid behind
a barrel, and two attempted to climb
up the hay-mow. One of these was our
hero Tom. But, alas, as he was scratching
up, the dog caught him in his back,
and gave him a terrible grip with his
long sharp teeth.</p>

<p>Tom screamed, and the old cat, who
was out behind the barn watching a
mouse, heard him. She knew that
something bad was going on. She left
the mouse in an instant, and ran into the
barn. I wish you could have seen her
as she approached the dog, who was
shaking poor Tom, in his teeth.</p>

<p>Her back was sticking up as well as
her tail. The hair of the latter was extended
so as to make it look as large
round as a lady’s boa. Her mouth was
open, her teeth bare, her eyes flashing
like fire. She seemed to dance along
the floor toward the dog, as if the wind
blew her.</p>

<p>Before the dog knew what was coming,
puss was upon him with teeth and claws.
Now was his turn to squeal. She bit
his ears and scratched his eyes, before
he could turn round. Then he fled,
yelling with all his might. Puss followed,
jump for jump, and laying her
claws at every leap upon the dog’s
hinder quarters, the hair flew as if her
paws had been a couple of curry-combs.
When the dog came to the street, he
laid down his ears, hid his tail between
his legs, and, stretching away, at last
escaped.</p>

<p>Puss came back, and there lay poor
Tom, unable to move. She took him
up gently in her mouth, and carried him
to the bed. She laid him down, mewed
to him with a soft purring voice, as if to
comfort him. She then licked off the
blood, and finally curled herself around
him, to keep him warm. Poor Tom at
last went to sleep. What a good mother
was old puss, and how much like the
kind mothers of little children!</p>

<p>The next day Tom was very stiff and
sore. He could not move, or sleep, or
eat. Oh, how he did suffer! But puss
was by his side, almost all the time.
She licked his wounds gently, so as to
soothe and not to hurt them. She kept
him warm, and purred to him, and did
all she could. In three or four days he
began to get better. In a month his
wounds were healed, but one of his hind
legs, being broken, was shorter than the
others, and always remained so. It was
also rather weak; so that Tom, when he
grew up, was lame, and therefore he got
the name of Limping Tom.</p>

<p>Now, you might suppose that this defect
would be a great evil to Tom, in
life. But we shall see how it was. He
was taken by a girl named Lucilla, or
Lissa, as they called her. Why she
chose him, rather than his more perfect
mates, I cannot tell; though I guess it
was because she had a tender heart, as
many pretty girls have, and was guided
in her choice by a sweet kindness excited
by misfortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
Well, Lissa carried Tom home.
Though lame, he was still a cheerful kit
as ever you saw. Some thoughtless
people used to laugh at him, as he flew
about, for his hinder parts went up and
down in a very queer fashion, as he
gambolled over the floor or grass. Lissa
saw nothing ridiculous in all this; on
the contrary, Tom’s limp was really
graceful and interesting to her. I believe
the girl loved him all the better for
his imperfection.</p>

<p>You may be curious to know how
this is to be accounted for. I will try
to tell you. Tom was really a good,
lively little fellow. He was not quite
so nimble as other cats, but he did the
best he could; he showed a good disposition.
This was a great thing, for
everybody loves a good disposition. It
is not necessary to be smart in order to
be loved. Do the best you can, and nobody
will ask more. Make the best of
everything, and you will satisfy and
gratify all around you.</p>

<p>Now, this was the way with Tom;
he was good-tempered; he did the best
he could; he never had the sulks; whenever
his mistress wished to play, he was
ready; when she was busy, he kept out of
the way. Being lame, he was humble;
being good, he was cheerful. So Lissa
loved him, and he was happy.</p>

<p>Thus, Limping Tom grew up. And
now he was a cat. It was his duty to
guard the house, to chase away the rats,
and keep the mice in order. He looked
grave, and seemed to feel the responsibility
of his station. But still, he did
not altogether lose his love of fun. Most
cats, when they grow old, grow dull and
uninteresting. They lay aside their
gambols and frolics, and amusements,
and accomplishments; they prowl about
at night with melancholy cries; doze
away life in the chimney corner, and if
you chance to tread on their tails, woe be
to you!</p>

<p>Not exactly so with Tom. Despite his
lameness, he was rather a jolly fellow,
still. He did his duty all day—but at
night, he regularly came to Lissa, and
provoked her into a game of romps.
Lissa was now a young lady, and a
black-eyed young man came to see her
almost every night. Tom was jealous
at first—but finding that Lissa liked the
young man, as in duty bound, he began
to like him too.</p>

<p>At last Lissa and her lover were
married. They went to live in a house
of their own, and Tom went with them.
He was a marked cat, you may be sure.
Everybody noticed his limp, and asked
questions about him. This led Lissa
and her husband to tell his story, and to
praise him. So Tom came to be very
celebrated, and a universal favorite. His
limp actually made his fortune; and the
reason was, that instead of growling and
snarling about it, he made the best of
everything, did his duty, and was good-tempered,
industrious and faithful. So
it seems that even a natural defect may,
by good will and good sense, be turned
to good fortune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> the little fellow sits with his
book, for he has now learnt to read. It
is evening, and his mother has gone to
see one of the neighbors, while he sits
by the bed of his little sister, to take
care of her, in case she wakes up.
How intent he seems in reading his
book!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
But I must tell you about Jack, when
he was quite young, and before he could
read. All children have a deal of curiosity,
and they ask a great many questions
of their parents and others. As for
instance: What makes the fire burn?
Why does the sun shine? Who made
the moon? Why do cats have ears?
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Now, Jack had his share of curiosity
too; but he took a way to gratify it not
common among children. He lived in
the country, and his father had several
acres of land around the house. Here
were high rocks, and some woods, and a
little valley where there was a small
pond. There was also a ploughed field
and a garden.</p>

<p>Now, Jack had a fancy for roaming
about his father’s grounds, when he was
quite a child, and if I must say it—when
he wore petticoats! By the
way, if any of my little friends meet
with him, I beg they won’t say anything
about the petticoats, for he is now a
man, and might be ashamed to be reminded
of what he once was.</p>

<p>Well, his greatest pleasure was to go
alone over the rocks, and through the
woods, and to the little valley. He delighted,
particularly, to go to the pond,
and see the frogs, and fishes, and tadpoles,
and leeches, and insects, that made
it their home there. He would stand
for hours upon the rocks, quite absorbed
in noticing the manners and customs of
these inhabitants of the pond.</p>

<p>Now, Jack was so much in the habit
of living out of doors, and walking about,
that the objects he met with became, as
it were, companions to him. He never
seemed to feel alone, if only some
flowers, or bushes, or trees were around
him. He was never impatient—never
restless—never in a hurry, while sauntering
among the objects which nature
had created and thrown in his way.</p>

<p>I will tell you an instance, to show
his great satisfaction when he was among
the bushes.</p>

<p>Just after he had learned to talk, a
young lady who was staying at his
father’s house, happened to go into the
woods, where she found Jack. He was
sitting by the side of a whortleberry
bush, which was covered with green
whortleberries. “What are you doing
here?” said she to Jack. “Jack’s waiting
for the whortleberries to get ripe!”
was his reply.</p>

<p>Now, perchance, some of my sharp
little friends will think Jack a silly boy;
but wait, lads and lasses, and hear his
story, before you decide. I have said
that he had a way peculiar to himself, to
gratify his curiosity. Instead of asking
a bushel of questions, one after another,
without waiting for a single answer, he
was in the habit of <em>observing</em> things,
and <em>investigating</em> things. In this way
he gained a vast deal of knowledge.</p>

<p>Perhaps, you may wish to know what
I mean by <em>observing</em> and <em>investigating</em>.
I will try to make you understand it.</p>

<p>One day in spring, Jack was in the
garden, digging up a place to sow some
pepper-grass seed. By-and-by he happened
to see an ant running along with
a piece of a leaf in his mouth. So he
stopped his work, and looked at the ant.
The little insect paddled along with his
six legs very fast, and pretty soon came
to a little hillock of earth, about as large
round as a small flap-jack, and twice as
high.</p>

<p>It seemed to consist of a heap of particles
of sand. Now Jack, instead of
running away to tell his mother about
what he had found, remained to <em>observe</em>
and look into the matter, or <em>investigate</em>
it. On looking at the little mound,
he saw there were a number of holes
in it; and into one of them, the little ant
with the leaf, plunged head first. “I
wonder where he’s gone to?” said Jack.
In a minute or two, several ants came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
out of these holes, and some of them
had small white things that looked like
eggs. These they laid down in the sun,
and went into their holes to fetch more.</p>

<p>Every ant seemed to be busy about
something. Jack saw several ants go
away from the hill. He determined to
observe them, and find out what was
going on. He watched one fellow particularly,
and he went to the distance of
as much as three yards. There was a
large dead fly. The ant went to work,
gnawed off his head, took it in his teeth,
and scrabbled back to the hill. Down
he went into one of the holes.</p>

<p>In a few seconds he came back, made
another journey to the dead fly, sawed
off a thigh, and transported it to the hill.
In this way he kept going out and in,
and in the course of an hour, the ant had
carried the whole carcass of the fly into
the hill! “Well,” said Jack to himself,
“I guess that fellow’s the butcher, and
supplies the ant-folks with meat.” And
no doubt Jack was right.</p>

<p>While all this was going on, Jack had
time to observe and investigate other
things. He saw one ant go as much as
a dozen times to a dandelion, and load
himself with the yellow powder which
he gathered from the blossoms. “I
guess that is the baker,” said Jack. He
saw several climb up the stalks of tall
plants, to get the juice or honey from
the blossoms. “I guess these fellows
are the grocers!” said the boy.</p>

<p>By-and-by, Jack saw an ant going
along, when he chanced to come across
another hill. Immediately he began to
smell about this way and that—but an
ant upon the strange hill saw him. In he
went, at a hole, and in two seconds he
sallied forth, with five or six other fellows
in his rear. They darted forward,
heels over head, toward the intruder, the
strange ant. He had become apprized
of the danger, and was galloping back
toward his hill, as fast as his legs could
carry him. It was a glorious sight, and
Jack looked on, with as much interest
as if it had been a fox-chase.</p>

<p>The little red ant that had stirred up
this affray, went straight ahead, and
pretty soon came to a ball of earth as big
as a walnut. Deeming it better to climb
over than to go round it, he began
to mount, when the leader among the
pursuers, a large black fellow, stuck his
teeth into his rump! Red turned round,
and grappled; both fell backward, and
rolled upon the earth! Such a scratching
and biting!</p>

<p>At last little Red escaped—having
given Black a severe wound. The
others now came up, and the chase was
resumed. By-and-by the party approached
Red’s home. Here he met
some of his friends. They carried the
alarm to the hill. In a few seconds, at
least fifty fellows, all red, sallied forth.
“I guess these are the soldiers,” says
Jack—and so they were, sure enough.</p>

<p>They took the direction toward the
party that had chased our little hero,
Red. Black had now recovered, and was
at their head. He mounted a small
stone to reconnoitre and see the force of
the enemy. He perceived that the force
was too great, and giving the alarm to
his party, they all scampered back,
jumping, galloping and tumbling, one
after another.</p>

<p>The army of the Reds pursued, and
finally approached the city of the Blacks,
close upon the heels of the ants that had
insulted and abused their fellow-citizen.
The blacks were soon made aware of the
danger that threatened them. The fellows
that had been out on the scout,
thumped on the hill, and forty or fifty
stout fellows rushed forth. They marched
toward the regiment of Reds, and now
a fierce battle ensued.</p>

<p>It was claw to claw—teeth to teeth.
They pulled and hauled—bit and
scratched; and after a few minutes, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
battle was over. One large, black ant
was killed. He was cut into four pieces,
and the Reds carried him home, no
doubt for a feast.</p>

<p>While Jack was busy in observing
and investigating these things, he heard
his mother’s call. Though he had been
engaged at least four hours in studying
into these things, he was not weary, and
would gladly have staid longer; but
being an obedient and good boy, he
forthwith went to his mother, and found
his dinner ready. It was one advantage
of his morning exercise, that the fresh
air had given him a good appetite. We
shall pursue the story in our <a href="#v5P125">next</a>.</p>

Grandfather, why don’t you speak to me?
Gran’ther, gran’ther! Pray speak to
Bell!”</p>

<p>“Well, child, what do you want?”</p>

<p>So spoke the old man to the little
child, patting her under the chin.
“What do you want?” said he. The
child begged him to read her a story.
Thus teased, the old man began.
Whether he read out of the book, or
made up a tale as he went along, suited
to his grandchild, I cannot tell; but here
is the story.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
<h2>
The Snow Drift.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once a boy who kept all
the cents that were given to him, till he
had laid up two dollars. I can hardly
tell the reason why it was so, but Dick
Liston really found as much pleasure in
putting his cents into a box as most
children do in buying sweetmeats with
theirs.</p>

<p>The reason was probably this: in the
first place, we like to feel that we have
it in our power to buy anything; to gratify
our wants and wishes; to buy things,
not only for ourselves, but for others.
The feeling of this power is a very
agreeable feeling; and the possession of
money gives it to us.</p>

<p>But Dick had another motive, added to
this. His father owned a few sheep, and
Dick wished to own one himself. So
he laid by his money till he had amassed
two dollars; he then bought himself a
sheep. What pleasure he did take in
feeding <em>his own dear sheep</em>! He called
her Nan; for everything is dearer, if you
give it a name.</p>

<p>Well, Nan must have the best potatoes,
and the best turnips, and the sweetest
hay,—for it was now winter, you know.
She learned to know Dick, and as soon
as she saw him, she would gallop to
him, expecting of course to get some
nice tit-bit. She was seldom disappointed.
Thus a great friendship grew
up between Nan and Dick.</p>

<p>But, now a new event came to pass.
Nan had a lamb! Dick was in a perfect
flurry of joy. He ran to his mother
to announce the happy circumstance.
He flew to his brothers and sisters, to
unburthen his bosom. He told the cat
of it—he told the dog of it—and away
he flew to tell his neighbor, Jack
Fletcher, of it. He then went back,
boiled some potatoes, and fed Nanny.</p>

<p>Every morning Dick was up bright
and early, to feed his sheep and lamb.
The latter grew apace. In three days
he shook his tail; in a week he nibbled
a straw; in a fortnight he leaped and
frolicked like a kitten. Each of these
events marked an epoch in Dick’s heart,
and was duly narrated to mother, brother,
sisters, and playmates.</p>

<p>At last, March came, with signs of an
early spring. The snow had fled. The
sun shone warm and smiling. The blue-birds
took it for spring; the hens
cackled in the barnyard; the geese
gabbled in the brook; the robins began
to build their nests; the gardener sowed
his lettuce, pepper-grass and peas.</p>

<p>Old Nan was also taken in by the fair
show of spring. She went with her lamb
to a distant hill-side, where the green grass
had sprung up. Here she nibbled for a
time, and at evening lay down to rest,
her infant lamb at her side. They went
to sleep, for the air was mild, and the
moon shone bright.</p>

<p>But, by-and-by, the clouds covered the
sky; a light rain began to fall. The
wind changed to the north-east, and the
air became cold. The drizzle was converted
into snow, which soon fell thick
and fast. The old sheep began to feel
alarmed, but it was dark, and she did not
like to travel across the woods and fields,
to her home, at midnight. So she lay
still.</p>

<p>But the storm continued. The air
was full of snow, and in the morning it
was a foot deep. Dick looked out of the
window, and, anxious for his sheep and
lamb, ran out to the barn. He could not
find them. He looked in this place and
that, but he could nowhere discover them.
At length, with tears in his eyes, he ran
back to the house, and told his sad story.
Having taken breakfast, he and his
brothers went to look for Nan. All the
forenoon they spent in the search, but it
was vain. The day passed, and the
storm increased.</p>

The Seasons.<br>
</h2>

<p class="center allsmcap ls">WINTER.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Winter</span> is a noisy, blustering, bustling
season, though in general he keeps himself
cool. Even as early as November
he seems already impatient to begin his
sway. If you leave a door ajar, he
slams it wide open and comes puffing
in, and blows the newspaper into the
fire, oversets the clothes-horse, and cuts
sundry other capers of the sort. He
takes advantage of every still night to
steal into the garden and pinch off the
heads of the flowers. He mounts every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
black cloud, and from it sends down a
flurry of sleet, hail or snow. In December
he clutches the reins of government,
and in a few days,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">In broken shatters through the frighted sky.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap ls">SPRING.<br>
</p>

<p>Though winter seems impatient to
begin his work, he is as loath to quit it.
In March it is time for him to depart,
but he may be compared to a crocodile,
who, having paid you a visit and staid
as long as he ought, pretends to go
away: but while he puts his head and
body out of doors, leaves his huge tail
writhing, bending and brandishing behind.
Thus, during March, winter’s
tail is left to annoy us with squalls,
gusts, tempests, rain, hail, snow. There
often seems to be a strife between the
seasons, spring and winter alternately
getting the ascendency. But, after
a while the latter finds his icicles melting
away, and to avoid being reduced to a
stream of water, he slowly retreats, first
to New England, lingering along the
Green Mountains, till, pursued by the
Genius of flowers, he goes across Hudson’s
Bay and hides himself behind the
hills of Greenland, or creeps like a
woodchuck, into Symmes’s Hole, till he
can venture out again with safety.</p>

<p>One of the first and most delightful
signs of spring is the return of the birds.
The gentle bluebird comes first, with
her liquid notes, chanting at early morn
the glad tidings of the departure of winter.
Then comes the robin, full of business;
then the sparrow and the wren;
then the woodpecker is heard drumming
in the wood; and then the pigeons are
seen shooting swiftly by in thousands;
and then the wild geese,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p class="unindent">high in the air, night and day, are heard
and seen in their long journey to the
lakes. Spring, indeed, is so full of
pleasant things, that we are well paid
for the wearisomeness of winter by its
return.</p>

AUTUMN.<br>
</p>

<p>I have heard a person, who had travelled
in different countries, say, that he
would like to spend the spring in Italy,
the summer in England, the winter in
the island of Cuba, and the autumn in
the United States. It is a season “when
the moon stays longest for the hunter;”
when</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The trees cast down their fruitage, and the blithe</div>

THE REVOLUTIONS OF THE EARTH.<br>
</p>

<p>Thus I have given you a somewhat
poetical view of the four seasons; and
by what contrivance do you imagine
that so much beauty, comfort and happiness
are brought about? It is by mechanism,
more ingenious, more wonderful
than all the contrivances of man. I
will try to make you understand this.</p>

<p>Let it be remembered that the sun is
firmly stationed in the centre of a vast
circle, called the earth’s orbit. The
earth continues to whirl along in this
orbit, going entirely round the sun once
every year. It is kept in motion very
much as a boy whirls an apple tied to a
string around his head; as the apple
cannot fly away from the boy on account
of the string, so the earth cannot fly
away from the sun on account of the
attraction between the two, which operates
as a string to tie the earth to the
sun and keep it in its orbit.</p>

<p>Well; now imagine the earth moving
around the sun once every year. But
you must recollect that the earth is also
whirling round every twenty-four hours
upon its own axis, and this axis runs
north and south. One end of the axis
is called the north pole, and points
always to the north; the other is called
the south pole, and always points to the
south. But it so happens, that at one
time, this axis inclines more to the sun
than it does at another. When the
north pole is inclined towards the sun,
the rays will fall more directly on the
northern portions of the earth. This
will cause summer at the north and
winter at the south. And when the
south pole is inclined towards the sun,
it is summer at the south, and winter at
the north.</p>

<p>Thus you see the rotation of the sun
on its own axis every twenty-four hours
produces day and night; and the annual
movement of the earth around the sun,
with the different inclinations of its axis
to the sun, produces the wonderful
changes of the seasons, which we have
noticed.</p>

<span class="smcap">Alexander and his Mother.</span>—Olympias,
the mother of Alexander, was of so
very unhappy a disposition, that he could
not employ her in any of the affairs of
government. She, however, narrowly
inspected the conduct of others, and
made many complaints to her son, which
he always bore with patience. Antipater,
Alexander’s deputy in Europe, once
wrote a long letter to him, while he was
in Asia, complaining of her conduct; to
whom Alexander returned this answer;
“Knowest thou not that one tear of my
mother’s will blot out a thousand such
letters?”</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
Constantinople.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> city, the capital of the Turkish
empire, is situated on the Bosphorus, a
narrow channel which connects the
Black Sea with the Sea of Marmora.
It was anciently called Byzantium, but
Constantine built it anew, and made it
the seat of the Roman empire, in the
year 328. From him it derived its
name.</p>

<p>It fell into the hands of the Turks in
1458, and has since been their metropolis.
The harbor is one of the finest in
the world, and is capable of holding 1200
ships. On account of its curving shape
and the rich cargoes in the ships there,
this harbor is called the Golden Horn.</p>

<p>As you approach Constantinople, it is
extremely beautiful, but when you enter
it, you find the streets dark, narrow and
gloomy. Every Turkish house is a
kind of prison, so arranged as to keep
the women in a state of jealous confinement.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
The men generally live in the
front part, they being the jailers of the
houses. There are no windows looking
into the streets.</p>

<p>It is impossible to conceive of a greater
contrast than is presented by the streets
of Constantinople in comparison with a
European or American city. In the
latter, all is life and bustle; the shops
are furnished with rich goods, and multitudes
of people, men and women, are
passing to and fro. Vehicles of various
kinds are also moving in all directions.
In Constantinople it is quite otherwise.
The houses, as we have said, are dark
and gloomy; the streets are mostly unpaved;
few women are seen, and no
vehicles, save now and then a miserable
cart drawn by oxen.</p>

<p>There are about 300 mosques in the
city, 500 fountains, and 35 public libraries.
The seraglio, or sultan’s palace, is
a city of itself. The harem, containing
the 500 wives of the sultan, is fitted up
with the most gorgeous magnificence.</p>

<p>The Turks spend a great part of their
time in smoking at the public coffee
houses. Here they seem to dream away
their time in easy indolence. A modern
traveller furnishes us with the following
picturesque description.</p>

<p>“Having just landed at Constantinople,
and being totally unacquainted with
the Turkish language, we entered the
first café we encountered, with our interpreter.
Two venerable-looking Turks
were squatted on a sofa, smoking their
long pipes, and exchanging, from time to
time, words uttered with the greatest
solemnity. The nobleness of their appearance
and gravity of their deportment
immediately attracted our attention;
and our curiosity was so excited,
that we asked our interpreter to tell us
what was the subject of their conversation.
He laughed at our request, but,
after being several times pressed, said,
smilingly,
</p>

<p>“Well, well! I will give you a literal
translation of their conversation. The
older Turk, with the green turban, is an
emir, that is to say, a relation of the
prophet; and the one opposite you is
one of the magistracy.</p>

<p>“Effendi,” said the emir, “fish has
been very dear for several days.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” replied the magistrate.</p>

<p>“Effendi,” said the relation of the

<span class="smcap">Wonderful Sagacity.</span>—One day last
week, when the crowd of fashionables
was greatest at the Union street exhibition,
a beautiful girl, who had fed the
elephant with sundry cakes and apples,
in taking an apple from her bag drew
out her ivory card case, which fell unobserved
in the saw-dust of the ring.
At the close of the ring-performances,
the crowd opened to let the elephant
pass to his recess, but instead of proceeding,
as usual, he turned aside and thrust
his trunk in the midst of a group of
ladies and gentlemen, who, as might be
expected, were so much alarmed that
they scattered in every direction. The
keeper at this moment discovered that
the animal had something in his trunk.
Upon examination he found it to be the
young lady’s card case, which the elephant
had picked up, and was only
seeking out the fair owner.—<cite>N.Y. paper.</cite></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the title of a Chinese collection
of tales, romances, fables, &amp;c., a kind
of publication in which Chinese literature
abounds. In the work mentioned
above, there are no less than seven
hundred tales, the titles of some of them
being, “Ghost of a Fortune Teller,” “A
Stolen Thunderbolt,” “The Literary Fox
advising Men to become Fairies,” “Elves
begging Fish,” “The Man with three
Heads,” “The Devil turned Matchmaker,”
“A Pig acting the Priest of
Taou,” “The Enchanted Tower,” “The
Ass of a Mohamedan Lady,” “A Demon
bearing Children,” “Vulcan’s Toys,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>The following are translations from
this work, made by a youth at Canton,
who was studying the Chinese language:
they will afford a specimen of a Chinese
book of “Small Talk.”</p>

<p><i>The Sagacious Pig.</i>—In the district
of Suhchow, in Keanguan, a man was
murdered, and his body thrown into a
well. One of the officers, having long
sought in vain for the murderer, was
riding by the well one day, when the pig
came before his horse, and set up a most
bitter cry.</p>

<p>His attendants not being able to drive
the pig away, the officer said to them,
What does the pig want? Whereupon
the pig kneeled before him, and made
the <em>kow-tow</em>. The officer then bid his
attendants to follow the pig, which immediately
rose up, and led them to a
house, and entering the door, crawled
under a bed and began rooting up the
ground, and continued doing so until he
had uncovered a bloody knife. The
attendants immediately seized the master
of the house, who, on examination, proved
to be the murderer.</p>

<p>The villagers, having deliberated on
the case, took the pig and supported him
in one of the temples of Budha; visitors
came frequently to see him, and gave
money for his support, saying, “Such a
sagacious pig deserves to be rewarded.”
After more than ten years, he died, and
the priests of the temple, having procured
for him a coffin, buried him with due
formality.</p>

<p><i>The Enchanted Box.</i>—On the banks
of the lake Kanning, in the province of
Yunnan, some husbandmen, while digging
up the ground, discovered a small
iron box, on which characters were written
in the ancient form (used in the time
of the Han dynasty.) The husbandmen
did not understand this writing, but the
characters by the side of it were intelligible,
and were as follows: “Given by a
fairy, in the first year of Cheching.”</p>

<p>The husbandmen, not knowing what
the box was, broke it open, when they
found a small <em>worm</em>, about an inch in
length, apparently dead. The boys,
collecting, threw water on it. The
worm then began to stretch itself, until
it became quite long, and then it darted
into the air. A hurricane soon came
on; the rain fell in torrents; the heavens
and earth seemed enveloped in black
clouds; in the midst of which appeared a
horned monster, fighting with two yellow
dragons. Hail mingled with dew descended;
and the houses and all property
of the husbandmen were destroyed!</p>

<p><i>The Black Pillar.</i>—Once, in the district
Shaouhing, there lived a man whose
name was Yen, who was married into
the family of Wang, and was taken home
by his father-in-law, who had no son of
his own. After the ceremony, Yen
returned to visit his family. His wife
having been suddenly taken ill, after his
departure, a messenger was sent by his
father-in-law to inform him of it. Yen
immediately left his father’s house, although
it was in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>By the light of a candle, he was proceeding
along the road, when a black
cloud, resembling the pillar of a temple,
descended between him and a candle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
If he moved a candle to the east, the
pillar also moved to the east; if he
moved the candle westward, the pillar
moved with it, as if trying to obstruct
the way, and not to permit him to
proceed.</p>

<p>Yen, being very much frightened,
entered the house of a friend, and having
procured a servant and another candle,
proceeded, and the black pillar gradually
disappeared, while he hastened to his
wife’s house. On entering, his father-in-law
met him, and said, “You arrived a
long time ago,—where have you come
from now?”</p>

<p>Yen replied, “Most certainly I have
not been in before!” Yen and the whole
family fled in astonishment to his wife’s
room, where they found a man seated
on her bed, holding her hand. As he
proceeded to his wife’s side, the stranger
disappeared, and his lady soon expired.</p>

<p><i>Fidelity of Cats.</i>—In Heängning,
there lived a lad, whose surname was
Wang. His father had an old servant,
upwards of seventy years old, who, being
extremely fond of cats, kept thirteen in
her house, and loved and cherished them
like children. Each one had a nickname,
and came immediately at her call. In
the reign of Keënlung, this old woman
died. The poor cats gathered round her
coffin, crying bitterly, and refused fish,
rice, and every kind of food; and after
three days, they all died!</p>

<p>So much for Chinese Romance.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><a id="v5P103a"></a>
<span class="smcap">Language of Animals.</span>—The acuteness
of the sheep’s ear surpasses all
things in nature that I know of. An
ewe will distinguish her own lamb’s
bleat among a thousand all bleating at
the same time, and making a noise a
thousand times louder than the singing
of psalms at a Cameronian sacrament in
the fields, where thousands are congregated—and
that is no joke either.

Besides, the distinguishment of voice is
perfectly reciprocal between the ewe and
lamb, who amid the deafening sound
run to meet one another. There are few
things have ever amused me more than
a sheep-shearing, and then the sport
continues the whole day. We put the
flock into the fold, send out all the lambs
to the hill, and then send the ewes to
them as they are shorn. The moment
that a lamb hears its dam’s voice, it
rushes from the crowd to meet her; but
instead of finding the rough, well-clad,
comfortable mamma, which it left an
hour or a few hours ago, it meets a poor,
naked, shivering—a most deplorable-looking
creature. It wheels about, and
uttering a loud, tremulous bleat of despair,
flies from the frightful vision.
The mother’s voice arrests its flight—it
returns—flies, and returns again, generally
for ten or a dozen times, before the
reconciliation is fairly made up.—<cite>James
Hogg.</cite></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><a id="v5P103b"></a>
<span class="smcap">Fighting Crickets.</span>—In China the
people take as much pleasure in cricket
fights as the Spaniards do in bull fights.
Two crickets are pitted against each
other, and crowds of people gather round
to witness the combat. The insects rush
at each other with great fury, and the
spectators, high and low, rich and poor,
seem to experience the most lively sensations
of delight.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><a id="v5P103c"></a>
<span class="smcap">Lying.</span>—This is more common than
some people suppose. A man who contracts
a debt without a good prospect of
paying it when due, is a liar. A man
who gives his vote to serve a party, or to
serve another person in disregard of
public good, is a liar. A mercenary
suitor for a lady’s hand, is a liar. An
editor, who seeks in any way to make
a false impression, is a liar of a thousand
tongues.</p>

Invention of Printing.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> art of writing is one of great
antiquity. At first, it consisted of what
are called <em>hieroglyphics</em>—which are pictures
of objects, or signs and symbols of
objects, or figures, expressing words to
the ear. The ancient Egyptians, the
Chinese, and the Mexican Indians, all
appear to have hit upon this hieroglyphical
mode of writing.</p>

<p>The invention of letters, for spelling
words, was of later date; and the writing
of them was later still. The first writing
was probably upon stone, and was
used, doubtless, to record great events
upon national monuments, as pyramids,
obelisks, temples, and other structures.
As the art grew more familiar, it was
practised upon wood, ivory, metals, and
leaves.</p>

<p>The leaves of the <em>papyrus</em>, from which
paper takes its name, afterwards came
into use, and for a long time were employed
for books, letters, &amp;c., as we use
paper. The papyrus is a water plant,
the root being always immersed in
water. It grows eight or ten feet high,
with a stout naked stalk: the leaves
are eight in number, sword-shaped, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
two feet long. They grow abundantly
along the marshy borders of the Nile,
and in some parts of Sicily. It is still
used in the countries where it grows, for
sail-cloth and cordage, and sometimes
for wearing apparel. Of the stems,
closely woven together, basket-fashion,
boats are made.</p>

<p>The manufacture of the papyrus into
paper appears to have been of ancient
date. The skin of the leaves, only, was
used. This, which was usually a foot
wide, was taken off, by some process,
and several layers were pressed together,
having been dampened by the water
of the Nile. Thus a texture as thick as
parchment was formed. It was made
into rolls, for books. The city of Alexandria,
in Egypt, carried on a large
manufacture of this kind of paper, and
derived great wealth from it. The
making of paper, from cotton and linen
rags, did not supersede the papyrus
paper till the eleventh century.</p>

<p>Writing was the chief means by which
knowledge could be recorded and diffused.
Tradition could carry down
events for a few generations, but these
soon became blended with fictions; and
with the destruction of a nation, its traditional
records vanished. The art of
writing, therefore, was clearly of the
utmost importance; and the means of
making it cheap and easy were cultivated
with care. In the time of our Savior
it had become very common, and well
educated persons, throughout the vast extent
of the Roman empire, were so far
acquainted with it as to be able to write
letters. Still, nine persons in ten could
not write, and consequently, a class of
persons, called scribes, made it their profession
to write. These scribes were
constantly applied to, to write letters and
documents of various kinds. If a lover
wished to address his mistress, he applied
to the professed writers. This
trade is still followed in countries where
education is confined to a few persons.</p>

<p>As society advanced, and great poets,
historians and philosophers arose, the
desire of possessing their works, of
course, began to prevail. Accordingly,
the scribes were called upon not only to
prepare business papers, but to make
books. These, for many centuries, were
only written by the pen. Until the invention
of the art of printing, every page,
every letter of a book, must be traced
with the quill. The making of a single
book was therefore a work of great labor.
None but skilful and practised writers
could pretend to write books. It was a
trade, which demanded careful training.
Until the invention of printing it required
about four years, of close and severe
labor, to make a single Bible! A Bible,
five hundred years ago, was worth a
house and farm of fifty acres! Now
you can buy one, and a far better one,
for fifty cents! This change is the
effect of an invention of which I am now
going to speak.</p>

<p>The art of printing, in some form,
appears to have existed for ages. Engravings
were made on wood, and
stamped on brick, at least four thousand
years ago, as appears by fragments
found among the ruins of Babylon, and
Thebes in Egypt. This art of wood
engraving, and taking impressions therefrom,
was lost for centuries, but was
revived, and at the time of the invention
of printing, was in common use, for
coarse purposes—especially for stamping
figures upon playing cards.</p>

<p>This art of wood engraving and printing
therefrom, was employed sometimes
in lieu of writing; the letters were cut
on the wood, and in the print these
were white, with a black ground. This
process is still in use, for the covers of
books, labels, &amp;c., and is called <em>xylographic</em>
printing. It is said to have
been invented by the Japanese, and was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
in use in China as long ago as the year
1100 B. C., about the time of king
David.</p>

<p>But still, the idea of making separate
types, one for each letter, and printing
books from them, had not been started.
This was undertaken by John Gutenberg,
a native of Mentz, in Germany.
He appears to have been occupied with
it in the year 1436. He then lived at
Strasburg, in France, and here for several
years he secretly but industriously
pursued his experiments.</p>

<p>In 1444, he removed to his native
city, and taking one John Faust into
partnership with him, he succeeded in
printing several works. They soon
separated, however: Gutenberg gave
up the business, and Faust pursued it.
The latter has sometimes been considered
the inventor of the art of printing,
but it belongs fairly to Gutenberg.
In 1555, the “forty-two line Bible” was
produced, and was so called because
each column consisted of forty-two lines.</p>

<p>Faust soon produced several editions
of the Bible. He went to Paris, about
this time, and it seemed so impossible,
even to the monks, who were educated
men, that he could make so many Bibles
by human means, that they adopted the
idea that he was in league with the
devil. It is a curious fact, that most
good inventions, of ancient times, were
supposed to be produced by the help of
the sable fiend. Certain it is that the
charge of sorcery was so laid upon Faust
that he was obliged to fly for his life.</p>

<p>We may here add, that the art of
printing, which has done more for mankind
than any other human art, not only
thus brought the life of one of its first
and ablest promoters into danger, but it
has been the special object of persecution
from the day of its invention to the
present time. We shall pursue this
subject in another number.</p>

An Equinoctial Storm; or, Adventures of a Hat.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> the 20th of March and the 20th
of September, of each year, the day and
night are of equal length, all the world
over; that is to say, the day is twelve
hours long and the night twelve hours
long.</p>

<p>The sun appears at this time to pass
from east to west, around the middle of
the earth, or over the equator. If you
were at Quito in South America, or anywhere
near the equator, either on the
20th of March or the 20th of September,
the sun would appear, at noon, to be
exactly over your head.</p>

<p>These periods of the year are called
the <em>equinoxes</em>, and for some reason which
cannot be well explained, furious storms
are usually experienced about the time
they occur. These are called <em>equinoctial</em>
storms. I am going to relate a story of
one which occurred a good many years
since.</p>

<p>It was in March, about the year 1815,
that Dr. Pill was riding along toward
his house. The wind was high, and the
rain fell in torrents. The doctor’s greatcoat
was twirled about his ears, and he
was himself almost thrown off the horse.
He galloped on, however, and came at
last in sight of the village steeple, near
which was his house.</p>

<p>Just as his eyes gladly caught sight
of his house, a furious rush of wind took
his hat off his head, and sent it away,
skimming like a hawk upon the
breeze. The dog pursued the hat for
some distance, but just as it appeared to
be falling to the ground, a fresh puff of
the gale lifted it high in the air, and
carried it over the tops of the trees, out
of sight.</p>

<p>Poor Dr. Pill could not now stop to
pursue his runaway hat—so, with his
hair flying in the wind, he galloped
home. The storm lasted two days, and
then cleared away. But the whole
country was drenched with a flood. The
rivers rose above their banks, and swept
over the plains; bridges were carried
away; houses were undermined and
torn to pieces; cattle were drowned,
and trees torn up by the roots!</p>

<p>It was near a week before the doctor
could set out in search of his hat. Taking
his dog with him, at last he went to
make an effort to discover his lost property.
Going to the place where it was
taken off his head, and proceeding in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
direction whither it had been carried, he
made diligent search for it. His dog,
Watch, seemed to understand what was
wanted, and exerted himself to the utmost
in the hunt. But all was unavailing,
and Dr. Pill was obliged to return
without his hat.</p>

<p>Several weeks passed, until, at length,
the doctor was returning home by a
bridle path that led through some thick,
wild shrubbery. Here his attention was
arrested by the barking of his dog, in a
manner so vehement as to show that
something extraordinary was in the wind.
The doctor dismounted from his horse,
and pushed through the bushes for about
a dozen rods.</p>

<p>Coming up to his dog, and looking in
the direction of the animal’s eye, he saw,
about eight feet from the ground, his
stray hat! He reached up to it with
some difficulty, and took it down, while
a smile of satisfaction covered his face.
But his smile was soon changed to a
gaze of horror—for, on looking into the
hat, there was an enormous black snake,
coiled up, and seeming to think himself
quite at home! Soon, however, the creature
lifted his head, brandished his forked
tongue, and showed signs of battle.</p>

<p>The doctor threw down the hat, and
Watch fell upon the snake. He took
him by the middle, and shook him so
violently that the reptile was dead in a
few seconds. The doctor now took his
hat, and rode home in triumph. The
hat, it seems, had been borne upon the
gale, at least half a mile, and then had
lodged upon the bushes. The serpent
thought it a convenient dwelling, and
took up his lodging there, by no means
expecting to be so rudely turned out of
house and home.</p>

<h2>
Yellow Hair.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> appears that the women of old
Rome were fond of <em>yellow hair</em>, and it
is found that they were accustomed to
turn it of this color by saffron, and by
long sitting, daily, in the sun; others,
instead of saffron, sometimes used medicated
sulphur.</p>

<p>This art of changing their hair with
saffron, was called <em>crocuphantea</em>. Tertullian,
observing this artifice of the
women of his time, told them that they
were ashamed of their country, and would
be Gaulish or Germanic women, so
much did they disguise themselves. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Cyprian and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jerome, with Tertullian,
pronounced the seeking by art to procure
red-tinted hair, as presaging to the
person who sought it, the fire and red
flames of hell.</p>

<p>Galen affirms that in his time numbers
of women died with the headache;
neither could there any remedy be applied
to this evil, because they stood a
long time bareheaded in the sun, to render
their hair yellow; and he reports
that for the same cause some of them
lost their hair and became bald, and
were reduced to Ovid’s remedy for that
defect, either to borrow other women’s
hair, or to ransack the graves of the
dead for a dishonest supply.</p>

<p>Tertullian, speaking on this subject,
says, that women were punished for this
their folly, for that by reason of their
long stay in the sun, their heads were
often most grievously attacked with the
headache; and it seems, when this vanity
was grown habitual to them, it degenerated
into dotage; for Lucian very satirically
derides an old woman, who, notwithstanding
she was seventy years of
age, yet would she have her hair of a
yellow tincture; he exhorts her to desist
from her folly; for though she could
color her silver hair, yet she could not
recall her youth!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
The Venetian women, even at this
day, and the Paduan, and those of Verona,
and other parts of Italy, practise the
same vanity, and receive the same recompense
for their affectation; there
being in all these cities open and manifest
examples of those who have undergone
a kind of martyrdom to render
their hair yellow.</p>

<p>Schenekins relates the history of a
certain noble gentlewoman, about sixteen
or seventeen years of age, who would
expose her bare head to the fervent heat
of the sun daily, for some hours, that she
might obtain long and yellow hair, by
anointing it with a certain unguent; and
although she obtained the effect she desired,
yet she consequently procured to
herself a violent headache, and bled every
day abundantly through the nose.</p>

<p>Another maiden, also, by using this
same art, became almost blind with sore
eyes. Painting the hair blue or red, has
been anciently noted by many poets,
who took occasion to describe it, as may
be seen in Pliny and Ovid.</p>

<p>This yellow hair was esteemed so
great a rarity, that oftentimes, also,
the natural crop was shaven off, and a
yellow periwig clapped on instead; this
Martial happily ridicules:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The golden hair that Galla wears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Is hers—who would have thought it?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She swears ’tis hers—and true she swears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For I—know where she bought it.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This, indeed, is carried to a great extent
in the Low Countries, where the
Jewish women, who are all black-haired
by nature, wear great yellow periwigs
instead,—golden-haired Dutch Venuses.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
April.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> second month of spring derives
its name from the Latin word <i lang="la">Aperio</i>, to
open, in allusion to the opening of the
flowers, or the opening of the earth to
receive the seed. Its zodiacal sign is
Taurus, which the sun enters on the 20th
day of the month. It is true that in
April the flowers do not always begin to
open, at least among us; but in Italy,
and France, and England, and also in
the more southern parts of our country,
it is a month of buds and blossoms. It is
the time for setting out trees and shrubs;
for ploughing the fields, and getting the
gardens ready for seed.</p>

<p>As this is a season which seems expressly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
made for the husbandman, let us
quote a passage we have met with in relation
to him.</p>

<p>“The farmer is a lucky man; he is
subject to few cares, diseases or changes.
He holds in fee a certain part of this
planet, running from the surface down
to the centre, together with the atmosphere
above it; and if any man should
build a tower overhanging his line by a
single brick, though a thousand feet in
the air, it may be abated as a nuisance.
It is a great thing to have a legal and
equitable title to a portion of earth, to
cultivate it, and to owe a support to the
application of strength, rather than the
misapplication of wit. The farmer is
independent of all but Providence—he
calls no man master.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘He would not flatter Neptune for his pitchfork.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“He is not only a friend of humanity,
but he is kindly disposed towards brutes.
An ox is to him in the light of a friend,
a cow is a benefactor, and a calf is almost
a child. He is clothed by the
sheep, and the cosset lamb is a foster
brother of his children, who have a
heavy day when their mute friend is
sold to the butcher. The farmer has
little to buy and much to sell; his means
are large and his waste little. He is an
especial favorite of Ceres and Pomona,
but he cares little for Bacchus, Phœbus
and other idlers.</p>

<p>“He puts his hand to the plough, and
if he look back, it is in a furrow like the
wake of a boat. In May he puts a
potato or two in the earth, and in October
he digs into the same place and
finds a peck of them. In spring he
covers with earth three or four kernels
of maize, and in autumn he finds ears
enough on the spot to furnish the materials
for many loaves. He hides in the
soil a seed, no bigger than a large bedbug,
and in a few weeks a vine appears
with several pumpkins attached to it, of
the capacity of four gallons.”</p>

<p>Who that walks forth, now, and sees
grass beginning to spring up from the
ground, or the little flowers peeping
forth, can refrain from reflecting upon
that Power that endows these things with
life? The following lines are full of
natural thought and feeling:</p>

<p>Among the birds, that, having spent
the winter in a warm climate, return to
us during this month, we may mention,
as worthy of particular notice, the familiar
robin.</p>

<p>This bird sometimes spends his winter
among our thick cedar forests, living
upon the berries of the cedars; but in
general he prefers to go to the middle
states, or even farther south, where he
lives a quiet and secluded life, till he is
advised of the melting of the snows.
He is then impatient to return, and often
runs the risk of a few snow squalls,
rather than be behind his time. He is a
familiar bird, and loves to build his nest
near our houses. He is a general favorite,
and should rather be treated as a
friend than an enemy. He never meddles
with the corn, though he now and
then filches a few cherries. His song,
however, is worth more than all he eats.</p>

True Stories.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">An Eastern Offering.</span>—The three
sons of an eastern lady were invited to
furnish her with an expression of their
love, before she went a long journey.
One brought a marble tablet with the
inscription of her name; another presented
her with a rich garland of flowers;
the third entered her presence, and thus
accosted her: “Mother, I have neither
marble tablet nor fragrant nosegay, but I
have a heart; here your name is engraved,
here your memory is precious,
and this heart full of affection will follow
you wherever you travel, and remain
with you wherever you repose.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></span>—In the prayer book of
his Majesty, King George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, where
the worshippers implore the Almighty
to bless and preserve “thy servant
George, our most gracious king and
governor,” these words were struck
out, and the following written with his
own hand: “thy servant George, an
unworthy sinner.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Bishop Heber.</span>—When bishop Heber
was seven years old, a party of his young
companions were amusing themselves
with riddles and cross questions. Reginald
was asked this question: “Where
was Moses when his candle went out?”
“On mount Nebo,” was his immediate
reply; “for there he died, and it may
well be said that his lamp of life went
out.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Talking too much.</span>—The Rev. John
Berridge was once visited by a very
talkative young lady, who engrossed all
the conversation in speaking of mere
trifles. When she rose to retire, he
said, “Young lady, I have one piece of
advice to offer you; when you go into
company again, after you have talked
half an hour without intermission, stop
awhile, and see if any one of the company
has anything to say.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">The Emperor Adrian.</span>—It is commonly
said, that “revenge is sweet;”
but it can only be so to weak minds that
are incapable of bearing an injury. An
elevated mind is superior to injuries, and
pardons them. The Emperor Adrian,
meeting a man who had insulted him
before he came to the government, said
to him, “Approach; you have nothing to
fear; I am an emperor.” This is an
example well worthy of being imitated
by those who are called to return good
for evil.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Peter the Great of Russia.</span>—As
Peter the Great, of Russia, was travelling
through a village in France, he saw
in a garden, belonging to a parsonage, a
man in a priest’s garment, with a spade
in his hand, digging hard at some beds
of vegetables.</p>

<p>The Czar, much pleased at the sight,
alighted, and asked him who he was.
“Sir,” answered the man, “I am the
clergyman of the village.” “I took you
for a gardener. Why are you employed
in this manner?”</p>

<p>“The revenues of my living being
but very moderate, I do not choose to be
an expense to my parishioners, but wish
rather to have it in my power to assist
them; they respect me the more, when
they see, that, to procure myself some of
the conveniences of life, I improve this
garden; and in this humble occupation
I spend as much of my time as the
duties of my ministry will allow.”</p>

<p>“You are an honest man,” replied
the Czar, “and I esteem you the more for
thinking and acting in this manner; tell
me your name.” He drew out his tablets,
and wrote down the name of the worthy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
clergyman; and after telling him who
he himself was, and giving him many
proofs of kindness, he took leave of him
and returned to his carriage.</p>

<p>When he went back to Moscow, he
did not forget this scene, and endeavored
to induce the priests in his empire to
imitate so virtuous an example.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Alexander the Great.</span>—Alexander
the Great, on being asked how he had
been able, at so early an age and in so
short a period, to conquer such vast regions,
and establish so great a name, replied,
“I used my enemies so well, that
I compelled them to be my friends; and
I treated my friends with such constant
regard, that they were unalterably attached
to me.” He once degraded an
officer of distinction, by removing him
to an inferior situation. Some time
after, he asked the officer how he liked
his new office. “It is not the station,”
said the officer, “which gives consequence
to the man, but the man to the station.
No situation can be so trifling, as not to
require wisdom and virtue in the performance
of its duties.”</p>

<p>The monarch was so pleased with this
answer, that he restored him to his
former rank.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">An Armenian Prince.</span>—The historian
Xenophon relates, that when Cyrus
had taken captive a young prince of
Armenia, together with his young and
blooming wife, of whom he was remarkably
fond, they were brought before the
tribunal of Cyrus to receive their sentence.
The warrior inquired of the
prince what he would give to be reinstated
in his kingdom; and he replied,
that he valued his crown and his liberty
at a very low rate, but that if the noble
conqueror would restore his beloved wife
to her former dignity and possessions, he
would willingly pay his life for the purchase.</p>

<p>The prisoners were dismissed, to enjoy
their freedom and former honors;
and each was lavish in praise of the
conqueror. “And you,” said the prince,
addressing his wife, “what think you of
Cyrus?” “I did not observe him,” she
replied. “Not observe him!” exclaimed
her husband; “upon whom, then was
your attention fixed?” “Upon that dear
and generous man,” she replied, “who
declared his readiness to purchase my
liberty at the expense of his life.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">A Female Slave.</span>—The late Rev.
Richard Watson, in his defence of missions,
states, that a master of slaves, who
lived near the Methodist chapel, in
Kingston, Jamaica, exercised his barbarities
on a Sabbath morning, and interrupted
the devotion of those who were
assembled for worship. This man wanted
money; and one of the female slaves
having two female children, he sold one
of them, and the child was torn from her
maternal embrace. In the agony of her
feelings she made a hideous howling,
and for that crime, was flogged. Soon
after, he sold her other child. This
“turned her heart within her,” and drove
her into a kind of madness. She howled
night and day, in the yard; tore her
hair; ran up and down the streets and
the parade, rending the heavens with her
cries, and literally watering the earth
with her tears. Her constant cry was,
“Da wicked massa Jew, he sell my
children. Will no buckra massa pity
neger? What me do? Me no have one
child!” As she stood before the window
of the missionary’s house, she said, lifting
up her hands towards heaven, “My
massa, do, my massa minister, do pity
me! My heart do so,” shaking herself
violently; “my heart do so, because me
have no child. Me go to massa house,
in massa yard, and in my hut, and me
no see ’em.” And then her cry went
up to God!</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
Shops in London.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> shops in London surpass everything
of the kind in the world. We do
not speak now of the arcades and bazaars,
where a whole village of shopkeepers
are associated together under
one vast roof, but of single shops situated
upon the streets.</p>

<p>We give a picture above, of one of
the shops of Ludgate Hill, and there are
others of equal magnificence in other
parts of London. The rooms in these
establishments are of great extent, and
fitted up in the most elegant and imposing
style. At the front, are windows
with plates of glass eight or ten feet in
length, and of proportional width; the
sashes are of polished brass. The doors
are of the richest mahogany, and the
entrance is altogether in the most sumptuous
style.</p>

<p>Within, the shop presents a scene like
fairy land. Splendid mirrors are so
arranged as to multiply the columns of
the room, and throw a long vista before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
the eye of the beholder: at the same
time, the richest and most gorgeous of
merchandises are displayed on all sides,
so as to strike the eye, and add to the
effect produced by the mirrors. When
the shop is filled with well-dressed
ladies, as is usually the case from ten in
the morning till three in the afternoon,
there is a bewildering splendor about
the scene, and one might almost fancy,
that a species of fascination, calculated to
make the customer an easy prey to the
shopkeeper, is at once the object and
the end of these devices.</p>

<p>The wealth displayed in the shops of
London is suitable to the metropolis of
the world. In one you see heaps of silks,
of the richest and most splendid patterns;
and if you pause to note their infinite
variety, you become at last surfeited
and sickened with mere luxury. In
another shop you see every species of
jewelry—and rubies, diamonds, emeralds,
sapphires, cameos, and intaglios, are so
rife, that you pass on, content that they
are not yours.</p>

<p>You come to a window, where gold
and silver plate are stretched out before
you in such profusion, that they almost
look cheap and vulgar! In one window
is a display of cutlery, so bright and so
fancifully arranged, that it looks like the
gaudy figures in a kaleidoscope; in
another, there is such an assemblage of
furs, that you draw a long breath, with
a smothering sensation, just to look at it.</p>

<p>Thus, as you pass on, one after another
of these shops presents you with its
treasures,—and all attended by every
ingenious device, every suggestion of
busy fancy, to set them off to the best
advantage. There is a perpetual strife
between the shopkeepers, to outshine
each other: each one is desirous of
obtaining notoriety, of catching the public
eye, of securing a run of custom—in
short, of being in the fashion and making
a fortune, of course.</p>

<p>Regent street, at night, seems like an
illuminated city. The lights in the
shop windows, arranged to display the
goods, are exceedingly brilliant; yet
they are generally hidden from the sight,
while they throw the whole flood of their
blaze upon the merchandise. The effect
is truly beautiful,—and if any one desires
to see the shops of London to the greatest
advantage, let them visit Regent street
in the evening. And one thing more—if
a person wishes to save his money
let him defer buying till he has been in
London a month; by that time, he is
likely to be so surfeited with splendor,
as to feel weary of it.</p>

<h2>
Fishes playing the Jewsharp.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have often a very queer story
from the far South and West. It is a
land of wonders; for there they have
alligators fifteen feet long; rattlesnakes
by the bushel; gallinippers as big as
gad flies; birds that cry out at night,
“Chuck-will’s-widow!” mocking birds
that surpass the far-famed nightingale in
song; pigeons in such abundance as to
crush the forests; wild deer that stare
you in the face from the bushes; bisons
as abundant as cattle at Brighton; bears
with claws five inches long; and men,
and women too, as brave as Julius
Cæsar.</p>

<p>Such things there really are, in the far
west; but once in a while they tell us
tales that are too much for us, sober
Yankees, to believe. Perhaps, in these
cases, our bush-friends are only quizzing.
They have lately sent us the following
tale; it is a little too beautiful, I am
afraid, to be really true. However, if it
turns out a fable, it is a very pretty one.
Only think, a tub of cat fishes, turned
musicians—and that too after having
had their mouths torn by the hook!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
Bravo! But here is the story, as we
find it in the papers.</p>

<p>“One of the wonders of the south-west
is the mysterious music at West Pascagoula.
A correspondent of the Baltimore
Republican, who examined it attentively,
thus takes the mantle of romance from
it.</p>

<p>“During several of my voyages on the
Spanish main, in the neighborhood of
‘Baragua,’ and ‘San Juan de Nicharagua,’
from the nature of the coast, we
were compelled to anchor at a considerable
distance from the shore; and every
evening, from dusk to late at night, our
ears were delighted with the Æolian
music that could be heard beneath the
counter of our schooner. At first, I
thought it was the sea-breeze sweeping
through the strings of my violin, (the
bridge of which I had inadvertently left
standing;) but, after examination, found
it was not so. I then placed my ear on
the rail of the vessel, when I was continually
charmed with the most heavenly
strains that ever fell upon my ear.
They did not sound as close to us, but
were sweet, and mellow, and ærial; like
the soft breathings of a thousand lutes,
touched by the soft fingers of the deep
sea nymphs, at an immense distance.
To the lone mariner, far from home and
kindred, at the still hour of twilight,
the notes were soothing, but melancholy.</p>

<p>“‘Although I have considerable ‘music
in my soul,’ one night I became tired,
and determined to fish. My luck in half
an hour was astonishing—I had half
filled my bucket with the finest white
cat-fish I ever saw; and it being late,
and the cook asleep, and the moon
shining, I filled my bucket with water,
and took fish and all into my cabin for
the night.</p>

<h2>
Tea.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> tea plant is a native of China or
Japan, and probably of both. It has
been used among the natives of the former
country from time immemorial.
It is only in a particular tract of the
Chinese empire that the plant is cultivated;
and this tract, which is situated
on the eastern side, between the 30th
and 33d degrees of north latitude, is
distinguished by the natives as the “tea
country.” The more northern part of
China would be too cold; and farther
south, the heat would be too great.
There are, however, a few small plantations
to be seen near Canton.</p>

<p>The Chinese give to the plant the
name of <i>Tcha</i> or <i>Tha</i>. It is propagated
by them from seeds, which are deposited
in rows, four or five feet asunder; and
so uncertain is their vegetation, even in
their native climate, that it is found
necessary to sow as many as seven or
eight seeds in every hole. The ground
between each row is always kept free
from weeds, and the plants are not
allowed to attain a higher growth than
admits of the leaves being conveniently
gathered. The first crop of leaves is
not collected until the year after sowing;
and when the trees are six or seven years
old, the produce becomes so inferior,
that they are removed to make room for
a fresh succession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
The flowers of the tea tree are white,
and somewhat resemble the wild rose;
these flowers are succeeded by soft green
berries or pods, containing each from one
to three white seeds. The plant will
grow in either low or elevated situations,
but always thrives best, and
furnishes leaves of the finest quality,
when produced in light, stony ground.</p>

<p>The leaves are gathered from one to
four times during the year, according to
the age of the trees. Most commonly
there are three periods of gathering:
the first commences about the middle of
April; the second at midsummer, and
the last is accomplished during August
and September. The leaves that are
the earliest gathered, are of the most
delicate color, and the most aromatic
odor, with the least portion of either fibre
or bitterness. Leaves of the second
gathering are of a dull green color, and
have less valuable qualities than the former;
while those that are last collected
are of a dark green, and possess an inferior
value. The quality is farther
influenced by the age of the wood on
which the leaves are borne, and by the
degree of exposure to which they have
been accustomed; leaves from young
wood, and those most exposed, being the
best.</p>

<p>The leaves, as soon as gathered, are
put into wide and shallow baskets, and
placed in the air or wind, or sunshine,
during some hours. They are then
placed on a flat cast-iron pan, over a
stove heated with charcoal,—from a half
to three quarters of a pound of leaves
being operated on at a time. These
leaves are stirred quickly about with a
kind of brush, and are then as quickly
swept of the pan into baskets. The
next process is that of rolling, which is
effected by carefully rubbing them between
men’s hands; after which, they
are again put in larger quantities on the
pan, and subjected anew to heat, but at
this time, to a lower degree than that at
first, and just sufficient to dry them
effectually without risk of scorching.
This effected, the tea is placed on a table,
and carefully picked over, every unsightly
or imperfectly dried leaf that is
detected being removed from the rest, in
order that the sample may present a
more even and better appearance when
offered for sale.</p>

<p>The names by which some of the
principal sorts of tea are known in China,
are taken from the places in which they
are produced; while others are distinguished
according to the periods of their
gathering, the manner employed in curing,
or other extrinsic circumstances. It
is a commonly received opinion, that the
distinctive color of green tea is imparted
to it by the sheets of copper upon which
it is dried. For this belief, there is not
the slightest foundation, since copper is
never used for the purpose. Repeated
experiments have been made to discover,
by an unerring test, whether the leaves
of green tea contain any impregnation
of copper, but in no case has any trace
of this metal been detected.</p>

<p>The Chinese do not use their tea
until it is about a year old, considering
that it is too actively narcotic when new.
The people partake of tea at all their
meals, and frequently at other times of
the day. They drink the infusion in the
same manner that we drink it; but they
do not mix with it either sugar or milk.
The working classes are obliged to content
themselves with a very weak infusion.
Mr. Anderson, in his narrative
of Lord Macartney’s Embassy, relates
that the natives in attendance never
failed to beg the tea leaves remaining
after the Europeans had breakfasted,
and with these, after submitting them
again to boiling water, they made a
beverage, which they acknowledged was
better than any they could ordinarily
obtain.</p>

The Finland Mother.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Finland</span> is a cold and barren country
to the north-west of Russia. The inhabitants
are simple and kind-hearted
to one another; to strangers they are
extremely hospitable. They are frugal
in their mode of living, and mild, patient
and resigned in their tempers. United
with great gentleness of character, the
women have a remarkable turn for
poetry. It is quite common for one of them,
at a party, or entertainment, to compose
extemporaneous songs, which are said
to be full of feeling and pleasant fancy.</p>

<p>The affection of a Finland mother for
her infant is remarkable. The latter is
kept in a little box, which answers for
a cradle. In this, the child is swung
from the ceiling of the house. If, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the mother has occasion to go to
work in the fields, she takes the child
and cradle with her. She takes them
also to church; and carries them swung
to her side, if she goes on a journey
twenty or thirty miles.</p>

<p>As a specimen of the extemporaneous
poetry of the Finland women, we give
the following passage, which is as it was
written down by a traveller, who happened
to hear a mother addressing her
infant:</p>

<p>“Sleep on, little bird of the groves.
Sleep softly, pretty red-breast. God, in
time, will wake you from your slumbers.
He has given you branches to rest upon,
and leaves to screen you from the cold
blasts. Sleep is at the door, and asks in
a mellow-toned voice, ‘Is there not a
sweet child here, who is lying in its
cradle, and is desirous of sleeping; a
little child, enveloped in white garments,
whose mild countenance speaks of the
repose of heaven?’”</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
Comets.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> a very splendid comet lately made
its appearance among us, it may be interesting
to our readers to be told something
about these mysterious heavenly
bodies.</p>

<p>Comets are a class of celestial bodies,
of which, comparatively, little is known;
they appear occasionally in the heavens,
approaching the sun from one quarter,
and, having passed it, disappear in
another. Unlike the planets, they seem
confined to no particular regions of the
heavens, but seem distributed indifferently
through space. The planets are confined
within certain limits, to the ecliptic,
and are never seen beyond a certain distance
north or south of it. In their
revolutions about the sun, they all move
from west to east; yet the comets are
governed by neither of these laws, for
they approach the sun, and sometimes
pass near the ecliptic, sometimes near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
the poles; some move from west to east,
others from east to west, the only law by
which they seem influenced being that
of gravitation.</p>

<p>Their numbers are very great; several
have been seen by the naked eye, and the
telescope has increased the number to
hundreds. What they are, or what purpose
they fulfil in the economy of nature,
is unknown. That they are material
bodies of some sort, is known from their
being attracted by other bodies near
which they pass. A few of them are
considered as permanent members of the
system, as they return at certain periods
to the sun, moving in very elliptic orbits,
some of which are known. The comet
which appeared in 1835, afforded all an
opportunity of seeing it. The important
point, relative to this, was that its orbit
is known, and the interval between its
periodical returns has been calculated.
Comets of much greater magnitude and
more splendid appearance have been
seen, yet this, as it relates to astronomy,
is the most important of all. The honor
of first predicting its return belongs to
Dr. Halley, a friend and contemporary
of Sir Isaac Newton.</p>

<p>What can be the use or nature of
these bodies, is a question which naturally
occurs, but to which science can yet
give no satisfactory answer; their peculiarities
being subjects of much greater
wonder to the astronomer, than to the
children who gaze on them. They are
material bodies, it is true, yet composed
of such materials as almost to leave
one in doubt as to their deserving the
name.</p>

<p>The younger Herschel says that “the
most unsubstantial clouds that float in the
higher regions of the atmosphere, may
be looked upon as dense and massive
bodies, compared with the filmy and all
but spiritual texture of a comet.” It is
even probable that the substance is not
to be compared for density with the air
we breathe; that if a volume of cometary
matter could be weighed, it would not be
found so heavy as an equal volume of
atmosphere.</p>

<p>I think you will understand some of
the reasons that have led to such a conclusion.
If you observe smoke, steam,
or any vapor, you will find that the
farther you are from it, the more difficult
it is to see through it. The fog which
hides the distant mountains, or even the
sun, does not obscure those objects immediately
about you; the thin vapor
which you see at a distance covering the
meadow, disappears on approaching it.
A body of vapor, therefore, becomes at a
distance perfectly opaque and impenetrable
to the direct rays of the sun; so,
were the planet Mercury composed of
materials of a like nature and density,
they would still appear, during a transit,
like a black spot on the sun’s disc. The
comet, however, instead of obstructing
the rays of the sun, offers little impediment
to those of a star. No vapory substance
perceptible to our senses could
maintain any degree of transparency at
a comet’s distance, but, if the volume
were large enough, would appear as a
perfectly dense and opaque mass; yet
during the visit of the comet of 1835,
a star of about the tenth magnitude
was seen through the most dense part
of it, within one three hundred and
sixtieth part of a degree, of its centre.
Through the centres of other comets,
stars have been seen, so small that it
would require a thousand to make one
as large as the smallest of those seen by
the naked eye. The conclusion, then,
is reasonable enough, that were thousands
of these bodies placed between us and the
sun, it would obstruct no appreciable
portion of its rays, and that it would
continue to appear in undiminished
splendor.</p>

<p>We shall have a little more to say
about comets in our next number.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is related of a child, that he begged
his preceptor to instruct him in the law
of God; but he declined, saying that he
was too young to be taught these things.
“But, sir,” said the boy, “I have been

STEALING.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span>, who was in the habit of going
to a neighbor’s corn-field to steal the
grain, one day took his son, of about
eight years old, with him. The father
told him to hold the bag while he looked
on to watch if any one were near to see
him. After standing on the fence, and
peeping through all the rows of corn, he
returned to take the bag from the child,
and began his sinful work. “Father,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
said the boy, “you forgot to look somewhere
else.” “Which way, child?”
supposing he had seen some one. “You
forgot to look up to the sky, father, to see
if God was noticing you.”</p>

<p>The father felt this reproof of the
child so much that he left the corn-field,
returned home, and never again ventured
to steal; remembering the truth he had
learned from his child that the eye of
God always beholds us.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
The Blind Beggar and his Dog.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a sad thing to be blind; but when
one is blind, it is pleasant to know that a
little dog may lead one by a string, safely
along the road. I will tell you a story
of a poor blind man and his dog Snip.</p>

<p>The man was very poor; and he
had no money, or children, or friends to
take care of him. So he used to go from
house to house, to beg his bread and his
clothes. He could not see anything at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
all: it was always dark to him. He
could not see the sun, nor the trees, nor
the earth, nor the sky.</p>

<p>Snip was a little lively dog, with a
full black eye, a nose turned up, and a
tail curling over his back. He was so
full of life that he used to go on three
legs more than half the time, as if it was
too easy to get along when he used all
four.</p>

<p>The old man had a string tied around
Snip’s neck; this he took in his left hand,
while he held his cane in the right.
The dog trotted forward, leading the
way, and the old man followed. Snip
knew the road that his master wished to
travel; so on he trotted, taking care
always to choose a smooth path.</p>

<p>Thus the dog and his master got along
very well together. Sometimes Snip
would play the old man a trick; for instance,
seeing some dog in the path, and
having a mind for a frolic, he would give
a sudden jump, and jerking the string
from his master’s hand, he would scamper
off, racing and chasing with his fellow
dog, as if he was mad.</p>

<p>In vain would the old man call and
scold, threaten and flatter, till Snip’s sport
was over. Then he would approach his
master, but take pretty good care to keep
out of reach of the cane. He would lie
down on the ground and whine, and
seem to ask to be forgiven.</p>

<p>At last, when the old man’s rage was
over, and Snip saw that his kind feelings
were apparent, he would run to his side,
and jump up and lick his hand, and
seem to say—“Pray forgive little Snip,
he won’t do so again!” The old man
would then pat him on the head, call
him good dog—and, no doubt happier for
a little bit of a breeze, they would both
proceed on their journey.</p>

<p>But, at last, a sad accident befell the
poor old man. In the spring, when the
river was very high, he was crossing a
bridge; one of the planks having been
carried away, the old man fell into the
stream and was carried down by the
waves. Snip jumped in after him, took
hold of his coat, and tried to pull him to
the shore, but it was in vain.</p>

<p>The poor man was soon drowned, and
his body was carried upon a little island.
When it was found, Snip was sitting by
its side, having an appearance of great
sadness. The beggar was buried, but
Snip would not leave the spot. The
people observed the affection of the dog,
and their hearts were touched by it; so
they carried the poor creature food. He
ate a little, but he wasted away, and in
about two weeks, he was found dead upon
the grave of his master!</p>

The Snow Drift.<br>
</h2>

<p class="center muchsmaller">[<i>Concluded.</i>]<br>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have told, in a former number,
how Dick’s sheep and lamb had wandered
away, and how a deep fall of snow
had come, making the poor boy fear that
they were lost.</p>

<p>In two days the snow was three feet
deep. It was impossible now to travel
about, and Dick gave up the search; but he
was almost heart-broken. He was sorry
to lose Nan, but his heart was touched, and
his tears fell, to think that she and her poor
little lamb were probably frozen to death.</p>

<p>The storm cleared away, but the snow
was deep, and for three weeks the
weather was very cold. Dick had given
up all hope of seeing his sheep and lamb.
But he happened one day to be talking
about them, when one of his playmates
said that he saw them grazing on a particular
hillside the day before the storm.
Dick ascertained the exact spot, and
with a feeling he could hardly define, he
went to the place.</p>

<p>He roamed about for sometime; but
what could he hope to see? The snow
was still deep, and covered everything
around. At last he came to a snow-drift
which rose by the side of a rock
to the height of several feet. Up this
drift he ran, when the snow-crust gave
way, and he tumbled into a deep cavern!
What was his amazement to find himself
at once in the presence of Nan and
her lamb! Dick could scarcely believe
his senses; but such was the truth.
They had been buried in the snow-drift,
and there they had dwelt for three weeks!
The old sheep had dug to the earth, and
had got a few roots; and she had eaten
all the wool off her back, that she could
reach. Thus she had sustained life,
though she was sadly emaciated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
By stepping and moving round, she
had made a room of considerable size
in the snow-drift, and it was into this
Dick had tumbled. Her lamb had fared
tolerably well, but he too was very thin.
It was really very affecting to see old
Nan welcome Dick. She bleated as if
her heart would break; she licked
his hands, and looked in his eyes in the
most beseeching manner. The whole
story of her sufferings and her joy was
told in her countenance.</p>

<p>Dick now let Nan out, and she with
her lamb followed him home. This
was a day of joy for him—and perhaps
he had no happiness in after life
superior to that which he experienced
in finding his sheep and lamb alive; in
leading them home; in telling the
glorious news; and in feeding the
creatures till all traces of their sorrow
were wiped away!</p>

</h3>
</div>

<p class="hanging"><i>Jack gets better acquainted with his new friends.—The
story of the dead horse-fly.—Aunt Piper.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> told you in the preceding chapter,
how Jack watched the ants in the
garden, and how he found out their ways
of living. He was very young at this
time, and having never been to school,
he did not even know how to read: but
by observing and investigating things,
he had obtained a good deal of knowledge.</p>

<p>As he had now learnt something about
the ants, he desired to know more: so
he used very often to go and look at
them. He did not stamp, with his heel,
on the ant-hills, and crush the houses of
the little busy creatures, and kill the
people in them. Some boys do this,
and think there is fun in it; but Jack
looked upon all innocent and harmless
creatures with a feeling of affection, and
he loved rather to help them, than to kill
or disturb them.</p>

<p>So it was with the ants. He used to
go to their beds frequently, and he carried
them little pieces of meat; and after
a time, when he came near, the little
creatures would run out of their holes,
expecting something to eat! In this
way they got acquainted with him, and
he with them.</p>

<p>One day he found a large dead horse-fly;
so he took it and laid it down at a
little distance from the ant-hill. Pretty
soon he saw one of the ants come near
the fly. The little fellow began to smell
about, and then went to it. He took
hold of it, and tried to carry it. He
then pulled and hauled with all his
might; but finding it impossible for him
to manage it, he set off for the hill.</p>

<p>It was as much as two yards that he
had to travel, but he very soon got to
the hill. He there met several of his
companions. He went close to them,
and seemed to touch them with his little
feelers. Immediately four of them set
off with him, and went to the dead fly.
Jack did not hear the ant speak, and,
perhaps, he had no voice; but it was
quite plain that he told his friends what
he had found, and that he wished them
to go with him.</p>

<p>When they got to the dead fly, they
took hold, and began to drag him toward
the hill. It was twice as big as all the
five ants put together; but they jerked,
and pulled, and twitched, and it was
really quite wonderful to see how fast
they got the carcass along over the
rough earth. Every ant did his best:
there was no lazy fellow among them,
shirking and shamming so as to put off
the hard work upon his companions.</p>

<p>In a very short time, the ants had
brought the fly to the hill. As they approached,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
great numbers ran out, to see
what was coming. In a few seconds all
was life and bustle, and it really seemed
like a city when some great sight has
brought all the people into the streets.</p>

<p>But the ants did not spend their time
in gazing: immediately they began to
cut up the fly, for he was too big to be
got into one of their doors. One sawed
off’ a leg, another a wing, and another
the head; each carrying his piece into
the hill. In the space of about five minutes
the fly was cut to pieces, and stowed
away in the city of the ants.</p>

<p>Jack was greatly delighted with what
he saw; he had now found out that ants,
instead of being hateful little insects, as
most people consider them, are really
quite interesting. Every evening he
used to tell his father and mother what
he had observed during the day, and
they were always pleased with his simple
stories.</p>

<p>But Jack had an aunt, whose name
was Betsey Piper, and who, having no
husband or children to take care of,
spent a great deal of her time in talking
with him. Whenever he met with anything
curious, he used always to tell her,
the first thing. She was not only kind
to Jack, but she had read a great deal,
and was therefore able to give him much
instruction.</p>

<p>Jack had got so much interested in
the ants, that he now begged his Aunt
Betsey to go with him and see them.
She agreed to go the next day, and Jack
went to bed, full of pleasure at the idea
of visiting his little insect-friends, the
next morning, with his Aunt Piper.
We shall tell the wonderful discoveries
they made, in another chapter.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Another visit to the anthill.—Honey-dew.—The
different kinds of ants, and other things.</i></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">As</span> soon as breakfast was over, the
next day, Jack and his aunt set out to
visit the ants in the garden. Jack soon
pointed out a hill, which he had observed
before, and they both sat down to watch
the little creatures at their work.</p>

<p>As usual, all seemed to be busy. Some
appeared to be occupied in bringing out
the eggs, which they laid in the sun, so
that they might hatch the sooner. Some
were engaged in cleaning out the house,
for they were seen to bring out small
pieces of sand, which they carried to a
little distance, and threw them away.
One was seen to come up with a pretty
large piece of earth, which he rolled
along with much difficulty.</p>

<p>While a part of the little people were
thus engaged in housewifery, others appeared
to be bringing them food. Sometimes
these brought flies and pieces of
insects; sometimes they appeared to
have filled their stomachs, and when
they met their friends who staid at home,
they would put a part of their food into
their mouths, and feed them, as a mother
does a child.</p>

<p>As I have said, Aunt Piper had a good
deal of knowledge, and she had heard
that ants sometimes get a kind of honey
from other insects. She was very curious
to see this herself. So she watched
some of the little creatures, and observed
that they went to the dandelions that
were growing near by. They ascended
the stalks, some of which were covered
with what is called honey-dew, a substance
deposited by lice, which live in
great numbers upon vegetables.</p>

<p>Many of the ants stopped to eat this
honey-dew, which they seemed to be
very fond of; but others, not finding any
of this on the stalks, mounted to the full-blown
dandelions, where they found
numbers of these little insects imbedded
in the yellow down. The ants immediately
began to suck the honey-dew from
them, and what was wonderful, these
creatures kept quite still, and seemed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
pleased to have the ants lick the honey
off from them!</p>

<p>This sight gratified Jack and his aunt
very much, and they spent a long time
in watching the operations of these curious
creatures. After spending two or
three hours very pleasantly, they went
to the house. Aunt Piper then got a
little book and read all about ants to
Jack. I will tell you a few wonderful
things she read to him.</p>

<p>There are a great many kinds of ants;
some are almost an inch long, and others
are not bigger than a grain of sand. In
some countries the ants build hills twice
as high as a man’s head. In Africa
there are white ants, that devour trees,
and they are so numerous that it is dangerous
for men to go among them, unless
several can go together and destroy them
at once.</p>

<p>The little garden ants are very harmless;
they not only eat up a great deal
of the honey-dew deposited by lice upon
plants, and which would otherwise injure
them, but they also devour a vast
deal of matter that would putrefy and
make the air unwholesome.</p>

<p><a href="#v5P155">In our next number</a> we shall tell some
curious adventures between Jack and
the beetles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> is a picture of the moon, not as
it appears to the naked eye, but as it
looks when seen through a telescope.</p>

<p>By means of a telescope, we know that
the moon is a great round world. It has
hills and valleys and mountains upon it;
but it probably has no sea.</p>

<p>Whether there are people living in the
moon, we cannot tell, but it is probable
there are; perhaps, too, that there are
animals of various kinds in the moon.</p>

<p>The moon looks bright, because the
sun shines upon it. When the moon
does not appear to be round, it is because
the sun does not light the whole of the
surface turned toward us.</p>

<p>It is very pleasant to read about the
moon, and the sun, and the stars; and all
children who will learn to read well, can
know a great deal about these interesting
things.</p>

The Meadow Lark.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is one of the handsomest birds
that belongs to our country. Its back is
brown, mingled with black; its breast is
a bright yellow marked with black. It
comes to New England in April. It
lives in the meadows; and both at morning
and evening, it loves to mount an
apple tree, and sing its song.</p>

<p>This consists of a few simple notes,
and though they are a little sad, they
are not unpleasing. The bird builds its
nest on the ground, and hatches three
or four young ones at a time.</p>

<p>When autumn comes, the larks gather
in small flocks, and proceed to the south,
where they spend the winter; but when
the cold weather is gone, and the snow
has all departed, they come back to the
places where they were born and bred,
singing their songs, as if pleased to return.</p>

Shrine of San Rosalia, at Palermo.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">San</span> Rosalia, the Saint of Palermo, in
Sicily, and whose shrine is prefixed to
this article, was, according to legend, the
daughter of William the Good, who
reigned in the year 1159. At the age
of fifteen, she retired to Monte Pelegrino,
in order to spend the remainder of her
life in religious solitude, and a period of
nearly five hundred years elapsed without
her even being heard of. In 1624, a
plague, which threatened to depopulate
this capital, raged at Palermo. A hermit,
whose name is not given in the
legend, dreamt that the bones of the
saint Rosalia were on the top of Mount
Pelegrino, and that if they were carried
in procession round the walls of the city,
the plague would cease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
After prayers and supplications, he
induced a number of individuals to go in
procession to the top of the mountain,
where the remains of Rosalia were found,
it is said, in a cave. Some pretend that
the body was fresh, and looked as if she
had died at the age of fifteen; while
others assert that there were only the
bones. Then they were carried round
the city walls, and the plague gradually
ceased. This was accounted a miracle;
and churches were built to her honor.
A chapel was erected on the top of the
mountain where she was found, and
priests appointed to perform divine service.</p>

<p>To facilitate the approach to those sacred
relics, the Palermitans, after immense
labor, constructed a road up the
face of the mountain, which is nearly
perpendicular; and though dangerous,
that by no means operates as a check
to the devotion of hundreds who seek
the protection and patronage of the
saint.</p>

<p>The pretended bones of this saint are
now annually carried about the city in a
large silver box, and, according to popular
belief, she has several times since her
discovery saved the Sicilians from the
plague. Long before the celebration of
the festival, she becomes the subject of
general conversation, and excites the
greatest interest. Her triumphal car is
made to an immense height, is built on
the Marino, and, when completed, is
drawn through the principal street by a
number of richly dressed mules, preceded
by dragoons with trumpets. On the
lower part of the machine is an orchestra,
and above it is a small temple, in the
interior of which are figures of different
saints, and on the top of all a large statue
of San Rosalia. Every side of the machine
is decorated with flowers, and
during the ceremony, the street is
crowded with people, and the windows,
to all of which are balconies, are filled
with ladies. At night there is a general
illumination.</p>

<p>The amusements at this Palermo rejoicing
vary each day: one night the
Flora Gardens are illuminated; on
another one, the streets; and in the daytime
horse-races. The latter, from their
peculiarities, are worthy of notice. The
horses start from the bottom of the principal
street, near the Porto Felice, and
run to the Porto Nuovo. They have
no riders, but have small bladders fixed
on their backs, in which are inserted
sharp spikes, serving, by the motion, to
urge them on. The prizes run for are
generally small, consisting of from ten to
fifteen ounces in dollars fastened to a
board, and the horse that wins is led
in procession with the prize before
him.</p>

<p>The illumination of the Madre Chiesa,
which is the cathedral church of Palermo,
excites the admiration of all travellers.
It is here where the box, containing
the bones of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Rosalia, is deposited.
The last ceremony is a grand procession,
in which the silver box is carried by the
principal citizens, who consider it a great
honor. Immense crowds endeavor to get
near to touch it, for they consider that
this act is a remedy for all evils.</p>

<p>The approach of this festival produces
general joy and happiness; and the
people are so attached to the memory of
the saint, that it is supposed that any attempt
to suppress her commemoration
would be attended with the most serious
consequences.</p>

May.<br>
</h2>

<p>“<span class="allsmcap">May</span>, the delicate-footed May, the
month of flowers and song-birds, of bland
and balmy breezes and genial sunshine,
the poet’s month, has come at last.”
Yes, it has come; but the first of May, in
New England, does not always bring
the song of birds, or the bloom of flowers.
In England, the spring is a very beautiful
season, and May is ever a month of
bloom. The first day of the month is
one of rejoicing. The people in the
villages assemble, erect a pole, and,
decked in flowers, they dance around it.
In France the people meet together, and
one of the girls is chosen queen of the
festivity. They have a very gay time
of it. Sometimes the season is sufficiently
advanced here, to admit of a similar
celebration. In Pennsylvania, and
the states south of it, May is a season of
general bloom.</p>

<p>In New York, the first day of May is
usually occupied by the people in getting
their furniture from the houses they are
going to leave, to those they are going to
live in. “The first of May!” says one
of the New York editors, “there is
something <em>moving</em> in the very name.”

the occasion:</p>

<p><a id="v5P131"></a>
<span class="smcap">Country Pursuits.</span>—How happy is
the condition of the farmer, and of country
people generally, at this fine season;
how great their privileges, living amidst
the fields which are now putting on their
green attire, the woods whose buds are
bursting into leaf, and the flowers which
are beginning to display their bloom!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
How great is their privilege, instead of
being amid the din of carts and wagons,
to be cheered by the minstrelsy of birds
during the day, and soothed at night by
the plaintive notes of the frogs, which
issue from every valley. How fragrant
the air—how cheerful, healthful, peaceful,
the occupation of sowing, planting
and pruning! Let no man living in the
country, envy city people and their fine
houses. Let no man, whose lot is to
labor with his hands, envy those who
live without labor. Of all persons, those
who live without bodily labor are most
likely to miss the great ends of life—health,
peace of mind, and contentment;
none so likely to obtain them, as those
who toil with their hands. There is
many a rich man, who has broken down
his constitution by care, anxiety, and
mental exertion, that would gladly resign
his houses, and horses and carriages, for
the good appetite, the sweet sleep, the
cheerful serenity of the day laborer. I
once heard of a beggar, who applied
to a rich man for relief from hunger.
“Hunger?” said the rich man;—“hunger!
why, my friend, I would give
all I am worth for such an appetite.
Hunger, indeed!—why, you are infinitely
less a beggar than I. Sometimes
you suffer, perhaps, for want of food;
still, in general, you can get a crust of
bread, or a piece of cold meat; and with
your appetite, these are delicious. Thus,
eating is, after all, a source of great enjoyment
to you. But I have no appetite;
I never eat but with aversion. Thus,
in the midst of abundance and seeming
luxury, through loss of health, I am
worse than a beggar.”</p>

<p>But let us turn our attention to the
practical matters of the farm and garden.
May is the season for planting Indian
corn, sowing oats, and summer wheat.
This latter, as well as winter wheat, has
been much neglected in New England
for some years, from an idea that it is
not a safe crop. But take my advice,
and try it again. Be assured that the
raising of wheat may be made very profitable
in New England.</p>

<p>Fessenden is of opinion that it might
be well for the population of these United
States, were we to consume as articles of
diet more poultry and less butcher’s meat.
In France, poultry forms an important
part of the live stock of the farmer; and
it has been said by well informed persons,
that among the French, the poultry
yards supply a much greater quantity of
food to the mass of the community than
the shambles.</p>

<p>You will find much innocent and
profitable amusement in your garden,
and will please to plant bush beans and
pole beans of various sorts, having enriched
the soil with horse or hog manure.
With regard to pole beans, you will do
as well to set the poles first, and then
plant the beans round the poles.</p>

<p>In the open ground, plant cucumbers,
cabbages, cauliflowers, late peas, early
corn, squashes, melons, gourds, &amp;c.
Hoe and bush such peas as have come
forward, and weed all the plants which
have made their appearance.</p>

<p>Let me say a few words in favor of
the birds, which, at this time, are on
every tree. A notion prevails that birds
do great injury in gardens and fields,
and hence, many of them are shot, and
boys are encouraged to persecute them
with stones. A person of long experience
has ascertained that birds, in general,
do far more good by destroying
vermin, than they do harm by the little
grain and fruit they consume. In a
district of Germany, there was once an
order given to kill all the rooks, which
are birds of the crow kind. This was
complied with, and the consequence was,
that the wheat crop was almost entirely
destroyed by insects, which the rooks
would have devoured.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
The Village of Economy.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a New England village, and
is remarkable for its pleasant, cheerful
aspect. Every person who rides through
it is delighted; and the place has such
a reputation, that the land is worth more,
and the houses will sell for more, than
in almost any other place of the kind
you can name. And this all arises from
the good taste, neatness, and order, which
characterize the inhabitants. I give you
a view of the house belonging to Capt.
John Pepperidge; a careful, correct, upright
man, who has risen from poverty
to ease and competence, by industry,
economy, and prudence.</p>

<p>His house stands three or four rods back
from the street; the front yard is green
and grassy, and decorated with fruit
trees. The wood pile is fenced in; the
barn yard, pig pen, &amp;c., are also tidily
fenced. It is a maxim of Pepperidge’s
that there <em>should be a place for everything,
and that everything should be in
its place</em>. This is his great maxim; and
he not only observes it himself, but he
requires every man, woman, and child,
about him, to observe it also. He says
it saves him one hundred dollars a year.</p>

<p>He has other rules, such as <em>a stitch in
time, saves nine</em>; and so as soon as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
stone falls off the wall he puts it up;
when a rail gets out of the fence, he replaces
it; when a gate is broken, it is
forthwith repaired; if a clapboard is
loose, a nail clenches it. Thus matters
are kept tight and tidy. Of a wet day,
instead of going to the tavern, he spends
the time in making little repairs. At
odd moments of leisure, he sets out trees
and shrubs—thus, year by year, beautifying
his place, and rendering it not only
more comfortable, but also worth more
money, in case he should ever desire to
sell it.</p>

<p>Capt. Pepperidge takes great pleasure,
and perhaps a little innocent pride, in his
place—though, to say the truth, it is by
no means costly. He loves better to
spend his time in making it more comfortable
and pleasant; in setting out
trees, improving the grounds, mending
the fences, &amp;c., than in going about
to talk politics, or gossip upon other
people’s business, or in haunting a
tavern bar-room. In short, his home is
comfortable, pleasant, delightful. It is
neat and orderly, inside and out. And
he has made it so; though his wife,
having happily felt the influence of his
example, contributes her share to the
good work. His children are well dressed—well
educated—well behaved. Can
such a man be a drunkard? Can he be
vicious? Can he be wicked? Who has
so good a chance of health, and wealth
and happiness? Who so likely to be respected
by his neighbors? Who so likely
to do good by his influence and example?
Come, Capt. Wideopen, I pray
you, and learn a lesson of farmer Pepperidge!</p>

<p>Let us look at the practical effect of
Pepperidge’s example. Formerly the
village of Economy was called Uneasy-Swamp,
and was inhabited by a set of
people becoming the name. They were
poor, ignorant, idle, and <em>uneasy</em>. They
were jealous of all rich people, and considered
the unequal distribution of property
a dreadful evil. They were equally
jealous of the wise, and considered the
unequal distribution of knowledge a
nuisance to be abated. They were also
jealous of the virtuous, and hated nothing
so much as a just and honest man. In
short, they were, half a century ago,
where some conceited but ignorant and
uninformed people are now—willing to
level everybody and thing to their own
standard. If a candidate for office was
up, who addressed their prejudices and
coaxed them with promises,—though
meaning to cheat them—he was the man
for them. The more ignorant a magistrate—the
more mean—the more base—the
more fellow-feeling rendered them
kind, and the more ardently they espoused
his cause. Such was Uneasy-Swamp,
a place which has its image
still in some parts of the country.</p>

<p>But Pepperidge came among the people
and set them a good example. They
persecuted him—reviled him—hated him—ridiculed
him—broke down his fences
at night—and played him sundry mischievous
tricks. But he was patient,
and tough in his patience, as the tree
that gave him a name. And he overcame
them at last. One by one, the
villagers began to imitate him. The
small brown houses gradually lost their
look of squalidness and disorder. The
swamp emerged from its shadow, and became
a cultivated valley. The little
farmers and the humble mechanics rose
from their degraded condition; education
spread its light; industry, frugality,
showered down their blessings, and Uneasy-Swamp
became the flourishing village
of Economy.</p>

<p>And thus, though none of the people
are what is called rich, none are poor.
The small houses are neat, and the fruit
trees, the blossoming shrubs, the green
grass, around them, declare that the
people are happy. They are not mad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
in the foolish chase for riches, which is
destroying more peace in this country,
than all the bodily diseases our flesh is
heir to. They are now, from better
knowledge, satisfied that the rich man
shall possess his wealth, both because they
perceive that generally speaking the laboring
classes are the happiest, and that the
security of property is the only steady impulse
to economy, industry, providence,
and the other important village virtues.
They are more fond of knowledge, for
they perceive that it increases their
power of being happy. They respect
talent and wisdom, for they know that
these are gifts sent by Heaven, for the
guidance of man to happiness. In politics
they are staunch republicans, but always
give their votes for men of sterling
integrity. A man who has the general
character of being an artful, intriguing
office-seeker, has no chance with them.
They are perhaps a little prejudiced
against cities and city people. If they
ever have anything to do with a lawyer,
they go to one who has been bred in
the country, and one who was in early
life a farmer. They think, and think
justly, that while this rustic breeding
gives a man an habitually honest and
plain turn of mind, it also renders him
more knowing, sagacious, and favorable
in his feelings in respect to country
people.</p>

<p>I cannot better close this sketch than
by introducing some lines which are
much esteemed in the village of Economy;
every man, woman and child knows
them by heart.</p>

<h2>
Mohammed.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the great changes which have
been made in the world, not a few have
been made by arch impostors, for there
seem to be no boundaries to human credulity.
Mohammed, the founder of the
religion which bears his name, was one
of these. Of his history I intend to give
my young readers a few particulars,
because I think they ought to know
something of a man who has given a
religion to nearly a third portion of the
human race.</p>

<p>Mohammed began his reign A. D.
609, in the fortieth year of his age. He
first shut himself up, and fasted and
prayed for a considerable time. After
this he pretended to have had communications
with the angel Gabriel, the particulars
of which he related to his wife.
Astonished by his vehemence and the
boldness of his pretensions, (for these two
qualities sometimes completely overpower
people,) she began to give out to
her friends and neighbors that Mohammed
was an apostle of God. Through
her instrumentality her uncle or cousin,
Wooaka, was gained, who is said to have
been a Christian, and well acquainted
with the Old and New Testaments.
Mohammed’s servant next became a convert;
and, a far more important person,
his young nephew, Ali, called the Fiery,
from the ardor of his temper.</p>

<p>Soon after this, Mohammed gained
over Abubeker, a man of excellent character,
who stood in high respect, and
persuaded ten of the most considerable
citizens of Mecca to follow his example.
They were all instructed by Mohammed
in the doctrine of the Islam, as he styled
his new religion; and Mohammed gave
from day to day, as from the angel Gabriel,
the revelations he pretended to
have received.</p>

<p>And now I wish my young readers to
understand a fact—namely, that it was
to an admixture of much good with his
imposture that the importance of Mohammed
succeeded. The religion of the
people among whom he dwelt was that
of an absurd and wicked Polytheism.
They were either infidels or worshipped
a number of bug-bears which they called
gods. Mohammed taught the great
truth upon which true religion rests—namely,
that there was ONE GOD.
He added, that Mohammed was his prophet;
thus mixing truth and falsehood
so artfully together that it was impossible
for the weaker minded of his friends
to separate them. Having believed that
Mohammed was the prophet of God,
they, of, course, believed everything else
concerning him. And when he asserted
that he put the moon in the sleeve of
his dress, his disciples believed him.
And at last the Mohammedan, although
a profound mathematician and an excellent
calculator, placed implicit faith in
his pretended journey to heaven on the
beast Alborak.</p>

<p>After a while Mohammed incited the
members of his family and his followers
to a grand feast, and openly announced
to them his determination to found a new
religion, and asked which of them would
undertake the office of vizier. All were
silent, till the youthful Ali declared his
readiness to do so, and at the same time
his determination to inflict vengeance
upon all those who dared to oppose his
master. How different was the conduct
of our blessed Saviour, who, when Peter
drew his sword and cut off the ear of
the servant of the high priest, said, “Put
up thy sword into its sheath; they who
take the sword shall perish by the sword.”</p>

<p>Mohammed, like all others who have
wrought great changes in the opinions
of men, had powerful opponents among
those who obtained rank and profit from
old errors. On several occasions Mohammed
was attacked by the adherents
of idolatry with open force, and compelled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
to change his residence, and often
to flee for his life. But these persecutions
had the effect, as all persecutions
ever have, to spread the faith they were
used to put down. Learn this, my
young friends, that the more you tread
on a mind full of enthusiasm, the more
it turns and flies in your face.</p>

<p>At this time occurred Mohammed’s
celebrated nocturnal journey to heaven,
on the beast Alborak, under the guidance
of the angel Gabriel. After this, great
numbers of people flocked to him, and
he began to have thoughts of founding
his religion by the sword. Exasperated
at seeing Mohammed and his followers
gird themselves with weapons of offence,
his enemies formed a conspiracy to murder
him; but, warned of the imminent
danger, he left Mecca, accompanied by
Abubeker alone, and concealed himself
in a cave not far distant. There he
spent three days undiscovered; after
which he arrived safely at Medina,
though not without many narrow escapes
for his life. This event, from which the
Mohammedans commence their era, is
known under the name of Hegira, which
signifies flight.</p>

<p>In Medina, Mohammed met with the
most honorable reception. Thither he
was followed by many of his converts;
and as the number of the faithful continued
to increase, he began making
preparations for war. Many of those
who followed Mohammed did so for the
sake of what they obtained from him;
but when the hopes of booty were added
to other inducements, thousands joined
him. His first great military exploit was
the spoiling of a rich caravan, led by Abu
Sophian, the chief of the Koreishites.
Mohammed surprised them, with an
inferior force, in the valley of Beder, and
inflicted on them a total defeat. He took
a rich booty and numbers of prisoners.</p>

<p>Many other successful enterprises were
now undertaken; but in the third year
of the Hegira, Abu Sophian, with 3000
soldiers, attacked Mohammed with 950,
on Mount Opud, not far from Medina,
and a desperate conflict ensued, in which
the Moslems were utterly beaten, and
the wounded prophet with difficulty
saved his life. Mohammed, with the
craftiness common to impostors, attributed
this defeat to the sins of the Moslems.
He then promised Paradise to
all that should for the future die in his
cause, and announced that everybody
had a fate; that it was of no use to endeavor
to withstand it; that every one died
at his <em>appointed hour</em>, and if he did not
die in battle, when the appointed hour
came he would die nevertheless. This
of course made the poor weak creatures
who followed him ready to do anything.</p>

<p>In the following year, Abu Sophian
appeared before Medina with 10,000
men; but, by a division among themselves,
this army broke up, and Mohammed
fell upon some bands of Jews who
had united with them. These he cut to
pieces, slaughtering nearly a thousand,
and carried away the women and children
into captivity.</p>

<p>The next act of the prophet was to
offer up prayers to God. He then sent a
summons to the principal neighboring
princes, and also to those of the various
districts of Arabia, to embrace the new
revelation of the divine law made through
him; and many of these princes embraced
his doctrine.</p>

<p>But the city of Mecca was a sacred
city, according to the religion of the
Arabs, and Mohammed knew the importance
of making his head quarters, if
possible, at so celebrated a place. He
craved permission to visit it and its
temple as a pilgrim. While at his apparent
devotions he converted two men
of great renown among the Arabs, called
Amru and Othman, and he in consequence
became more powerful and raised
a larger army. Having made war on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
the city of Muta, in Palestine, he soon
returned to Mecca with an army of
12,000 men; and, having defeated the
Koreishites, compelled them, with the
point of the sword at their throats, to embrace
the Islam. The idols of the Kaba
were demolished, and the sacred touch of
the prophet made the black stone an object
of greater veneration. The temple
became the sanctuary of the religion of
Mohammed, and its professors were allowed
access alone to the holy city of Mecca.</p>

<p>Mohammed now destroyed all the
idols he could lay his hands upon; and,
going forward in the same course he had
begun, and now at the head of 30,000
men, he marched into Syria, claiming
homage from all he conquered, and soon
became the master of the whole of Arabia.
He forced his religion upon the inhabitants,
but allowed the Christians free
toleration.</p>

<p>In the tenth year of the Hegira, Mohammed
took his farewell pilgrimage to
Mecca; and on this occasion he was
surrounded with the utmost splendor,
and attended by 100,000 of his friends
and followers. This was the last and
most important event of his life; for,
soon after his return to Medina, he died,
in the eleventh year of the Hegira, and
in the sixty-third year of his age.</p>

A Fourth of July Oration,</b></span><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br>
</p>
<p class="center allsmcap">BY ONE ALCOHOL.<br>
</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">Ladies and Gentlemen</span>,—This is a
great day—a day of independence. It
is a day upon which myself and one
Gunpowder, have long been accustomed
to make a display. I hope that the foolish
attempt to celebrate the fourth of July
without us, will be frowned down. Who
ever thought of being funny without being
fuddled? Who ever thought of being
truly independent, and setting all law
and gospel at defiance, without my
help?</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am a great
character. Forgive me, if, on this
glorious occasion, I set forth my merits.
It is one of my privileges, as well as
that of my subjects, to be boastful and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
vain-glorious. I shall, therefore, proceed
to speak of myself.</p>

<p>My name is <em>Alcohol</em>! I solicit the
favor of your attention to a subject, which
lies near my heart. I am a great prince,
and, like other distinguished potentates,
I have my followers. To thousands and
tens of thousands of these, I feel under
profound obligations for the homage they
have done me. They have loved me to
<em>intoxication</em>; and, in doing me reverence,
have often <em>fallen</em> at my feet. If
the heathen prostrate themselves before
stocks and stones, may not Christians
prostrate themselves before me?</p>

<p>Allow me to tell you something of my
subjects. Let me expatiate upon their
merits. Let me set forth some of their
characteristics; and then pronounce your
judgment—then say, if monarch ever had
higher reason than Alcohol to be proud
of his people.</p>

<p>And <em>first</em>; my followers are remarkably
<em>devoted</em>.</p>

<p>From the standards of Napoleon, Wellington,
and even that of Washington,
<em>desertion</em> was not uncommon. But, until
recently, this crime has scarcely been
known in <em>my</em> army. For my sake I
have known my friends forsake father
and mother, wife and children. Nay,
such has been their zeal in my cause,
that they have sacrificed property, health,
and even life itself. Indeed, I may say,
that from a <em>pure</em> devotion to me, thousands
have come to an untimely grave.</p>

<p>The most popular monarchs have their
enemies. Doubtless, I have mine, particularly
in these sad days of delusion
and pretended reform. But, then, I
have reason to think, that some, and
probably the number is large, though
ostensibly my enemies, are <em>secretly</em> my
friends. From motives of <em>policy</em>, they say
they must <em>appear</em> to be against me, but
when <em>closeted</em> they assure me that they
still <em>love</em> me, and I think they often give
no small evidence of the fact. They have
a deep <em>intestine</em> attachment to me. Upon
these friends I depend to restore me to
my former honors, and had they the
power, I think I should reign as triumphantly
as ever.</p>

<p>Before I proceed farther, I must say a
word about my domestic affairs, and
which explains the trouble that has
grown up in society, in respect to me.
Many years ago I was married to Cold
Water. We had a large family, the
pride of which we called Grog, and a
glorious fellow he was too. I hardly
knew his equal, unless it was Toddy—the
drollest dog you ever met with.
Such times as we did have! Toddy,
Grog, and the rest, used to fall to and
scratch, bite, pull hair, give black eyes,
&amp;c. Those were glorious days, and I
am sorry to say, that the times have
grown very degenerate. I positively fear
that a row or a black eye will not be
heard of ten years hence.</p>

<p>However, I must go on with my
speech. Some evil-minded persons
brought about a divorce between me and
Cold Water; she then set up for herself,
and since that time, there’s been a regular
strife between us. We’re now trying
to see which shall get the biggest
army, and the consequence is that society
is torn to pieces. My dear friends, listen
to me, and then choose on which side
you will enlist.</p>

<p>Let me tell you something about my
followers. In the first place they are
<em>brave</em>. In a single instance, during the
revolutionary war, the English officers
mingled gunpowder with the spirit, in
order to inspire their soldiers with greater
courage. I could have taught them a
better lesson than this. They needed a
little <em>Fourth proof Jamaica</em>. <span class="smcap">Fourth
proof</span>, you observe—<em>that</em> manufactures
the courage. Why, I never yet saw an
army or a rabble, whose courage flagged,
if they had taken a sufficient quantity
of the pure “<em>critter</em>,”—pure, pure, you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
observe, not weakened down till you
couldn’t tell whether there was most
water, or most spirit. I have some
<em>veterans</em> in my service, which I think
would stand an action as hot as Bunker
Hill is said to have been. These are
my <em>red-eyed</em> and <em>red-nosed</em> soldiers, and
whom I keep as a <i lang="fr">corps de reserve</i>. I
think of enrolling them in a regiment by
themselves. They are without “fear
of things present or things to come.”
Promotion is certain in this corps, and all
my soldiers get into it, after a proper
length of service. My subjects, also,
possess strong points of <em>similarity</em>.</p>

<p>And 1st., of their <em>uniform</em>. The uniform
adopted by me is <em>red</em>, sometimes
bearing upon purple. My subjects look
exceedingly well in it, especially when
set with jewels, known by the name of
<em>carbuncles</em>. A few prefer a <em>pale</em> exterior
for their uniform, inclining to <em>yellow</em>.
These are those whom I call <em>gin</em>-ites.
They are mostly of the softer sex, who
have acquired this pallid look by the use
of gin or opium, and snuff. To my eye,
there is nothing in creation half so
beautiful as a woman, under the influence
of gin or opium, in the attitude of
taking <em>snuff</em>, especially when her fingers
scatter it over her dress like a Scotch
mist.</p>

<p><abbr title="second">2d.</abbr> <em>Language.</em> My subjects belong to
different countries, and consequently
speak different languages. But even
here strong resemblances may be traced.
Whatever be their mother tongue, their
accents, inflexions and <em>cadences</em>, especially
the latter, are strikingly similar.
Some <em>lisp</em> beautifully—some have an
elegant <em>clip</em> of their words—others at
times are affected with <em>hesitancy</em> and
<em>stammering</em>, or perhaps they are unable
to speak at all. I have known persons
complain that it is difficult to understand
them; but it must be remembered, that
union is a great thing, and this affection
of the speech makes all alike, and therefore
cultivates fellow-feeling, which
makes us kind to one another.</p>

<p><abbr title="third">3d.</abbr> <i>Attitudes.</i> In this term, I include
walking, marching, riding and evolutions
in general; in all which my followers
exhibit a wonderful sameness. You
would at once perceive that they had
been disciplined by the same master, and
were actuated by the same <em>spirit</em>. The
many graces of action are probably better
understood by them, than by any
other people on the globe. I have often
been in ecstasies, in looking at one of my
veterans, advancing towards me—he has
given me such a delightful idea of <em>Hogarth’s
waving line of beauty</em>. But my
<em>mounted</em> volunteers are, perhaps, my
greatest pride. In elegant horsemanship,
they excel. I doubt whether Mohammed
himself, when he rode Alborak,
presented a finer appearance than some
of our <em>Knights of the Bottle</em>. They are
so easy—so full of elegant motion—now
on this side—now on that—forwards and
backwards—lateral, circular, and zigzag,
that you would decide it to be equal to
any “<em>ground</em> tumbling” you ever met
with. And with all their <em>courtesies</em>, for
they seldom pass any one without making
a <em>profound</em> bow—they seldom lose
their balance so as to fall. This I account
for, in some instances at least, from
the sagacity of their horses, which usually
know more than their riders!</p>

<p><i>A fourth characteristic is Independence.</i>
My followers are ever ready to
pay me and my family the honors of
sovereignty; but here their homage terminates.
They are, to a man, <em>freemen</em>,
and have taken their oath a thousand
times, that they will live <em>freely</em>, however
they may die. They sing beautifully,
and sincerely, especially such couplets
as these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“He that lives and goes to bed mellow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lives as he ought to do, and dies a clever fellow.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Generally, they feel rich, however poor;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
and have golden prospects, without the
certainty of a single dollar. I have
known them, even when lying at the
bottom of a ditch, and unable to move a
limb—so buoyant with spirits, as to call
out to the universe—“to the right wheel,
march!”</p>

<p>A <i>fifth</i> characteristic of my subjects
is, <em>genius</em>. The tendency of all my influence
is to bring the <em>energies of the
skull into action</em>. Under my tuition,
genius is sure to expand; and I have
known even those who were thought to be
wanting in common sense, to have heads
that would delight Spurzheim himself.
Phrenologists often talk about <em>bumps</em>, as
indications of great powers. This is
sound philosophy, and I have a mode of
making bumps by an expeditious process.
I assure you, I have known a
whole family of geniuses made in one
night, at a bar-room or a grog-shop. A
jug of the pure thing is superior to a
college education, for developments of
the craniology.</p>

<p>Finally, my friends, one of my people
knows more than anybody else—or he
thinks he does, which is the same thing.
It is an old adage, that “<cite>the drunken
man thinks the world turns round</cite>.”
What a glorious privilege! It is true
that he reels and staggers, and perhaps
tumbles down; but still, he thinks that
he alone is upright, steadfast and perpendicular!
while everybody else is tipping
and diving as if there was an earthquake!
Is not this an enviable superiority? Thus
it is, my friends, if you embrace me, you
will, in your own heart and mind, be</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent14">——“glorious,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O’er all your enemies victorious!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">You may be clothed in rags, tumbled
into a gutter—an object of pity and sorrow

<span class="smcap">Clean Clothes.</span>—Purity of vesture
seems to be a principal precept of nature,
and observable throughout the animal
creation. Fishes, from the nature of the
element in which they reside, can contract
but little impurity. Birds are unceasingly
attentive to neatness and
lustration of their plumage. All the
slug race, though covered with slimy
matter, calculated to collect extraneous
things, and reptiles are perfectly free
from soil. The fur and hair of beasts,
in a state of liberty and health, is never
filthy, or sullied with dirt.</p>

<p>Some birds roll themselves in dust, and
occasionally particular beasts cover themselves
with mire; but this is not from
any liking or inclination for such things,
but to free themselves from annoyances,
or prevent the bites of minute insects.
Whether birds in pluming, or beasts in
dressing themselves, be directed by any
instinctive faculty, we know not, but
they evidently derive pleasure from the
operation, and thus the feeling of enjoyment,
even if the sole motive, becomes
to them an essential source of comfort

Heathen Mythology.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> many years ago, the people,
over almost all Europe and a large part
of Asia, believed in gods whom they
called Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Apollo,
&amp;c. They believed in goddesses too,
such as Juno, Venus, Vesta, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These people built temples in honor
of their gods and goddesses, many of
which were very splendid. In these
temples they had statues of the particular
gods to whom they were dedicated.
Here, also, there were priests, who offered
sacrifices to the gods, such as bulls,
sheep, birds, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This system, having its origin in the
fancy of man, was called <em>Mythology</em>—which
means a religion of fables. It is
supposed to have been commenced by
the Egyptians, three or four thousand
years ago, when the greater part of the
world was in a state of barbarism, or
perhaps, uninhabited by man.</p>

<p>This mythology, or religion of fables,
probably began in this way. Some poet,
having heard of the great deeds of some
warrior, made a poem about him, and
not only told things which he did, but
some things which he did not. He
represented him as having power above
other men, and as performing deeds
which man, alone, could not do.</p>

<p>Some other poet, afterwards, took up
the story, and added other wonderful
tales about this great warrior. The
story thus begun, would increase very
fast; for it is very easy to tell great
stories, and very easy for ignorant people
to believe them too. Thus, in the course
of two generations, the warrior became a
being quite above mankind, and therefore
a god.</p>

<p>When once such a system was begun,
it was quite natural that it should increase.
Every man of lively imagination
could invent a god or a goddess, and
the people were likely to adopt them, as
fast as they could be manufactured. The
priests and poets had both an interest in
carrying on this business, for they either
got a living by it, or gained freedom, fame
and consequence among the people.</p>

<p>The Greeks, for many ages after they
settled their country, which took place
above three thousand seven hundred
years ago, held constant communication
with Egypt. To this country they went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
for education and for the arts. They
not only imitated their buildings, furniture
and curtains, but they adopted the
Egyptian religion also. The Greeks
were, however, a people of a great deal
of genius. Beginning with Egyptian
arts and customs, they modified or
changed them, by the suggestions of
their own taste and fancy. Thus, in
time, they soon became superior, in many
things, to the Egyptians, who were their
schoolmasters.</p>

<p>The mythology of the Egyptians was
soon changed, in the hands of the lively
and inventive Greeks; and, indeed, it became
so different, that it got the name at
last of the Grecian mythology. A large
part of the poetry and literature of the
Greeks was filled with the achievements
of their gods and goddesses. Men of
the greatest genius, such as Homer,
Hesiod, Anacreon, and others, wrote
splendid pieces about the fabulous deities;
and the people believed them all
to be true.</p>

<p>According to these poets, Jupiter or
Jove was the greatest of the gods. He
was represented in the temples, as sitting
on a throne, with the eagle, the most
powerful of birds, at his side, as an
emblem of his superiority. In his hand,
he held thunderbolts, ready to hurl them
forth upon his enemies. He was supposed
to reside chiefly upon Olympus, a
tall mountain of Greece, where he held
councils with his deities.</p>

<p>The early history of Jupiter, as told
by the poets, is droll enough. The
ancients knew very little about astronomy
or geography. So they divided the
universe into three great kingdoms—the
heavens, the earth, and the infernal
regions. Titan, a powerful king, gave
Saturn the kingdom of the earth, upon
condition that he should kill all his male
children. Saturn married a woman by
the name of Ops. They had several
children, but as soon as a boy was born,
Saturn always ate him up.</p>

<p>At last little Jupiter was born—and
Ops determined to save him. Accordingly
she gave Saturn a stone, and told
him it was the boy. Saturn devoured
it—and did not discover the cheat.
This is a hard story, but the Greeks believed
it, and we must not laugh at
them, for we see things quite as foolish
in our day. The Mormons, who live
in Illinois, believe that one Joe Smith, a
vile and wicked man, found certain brass
plates, written over with a revelation
from God, which he alone could translate;
and they think this translation,
which they call the Book of Mormon,
is as true as the Bible. There are certain
deluded people, even among us,
misled by one Miller, who imagines that
the world is to be speedily destroyed.
These things teach us how easy it is to
be deceived in religious matters, and how
careful we should be not to adopt new
and singular notions upon this important
subject.</p>

<p>Jupiter, having escaped his father’s
jaws, was nursed by a goat. When he
was a year old, he was a prodigious fellow.
By this time the Titans had imprisoned
his father, Saturn. So Jupiter
made war upon them; he released his
father, and conquered heaven, earth and
hell. The heaven and earth he reserved
to himself; the sea he gave to Neptune,
and the lower regions to Pluto.</p>

<p>Jupiter was supposed to be immortal,
and of boundless power; but he yet had
the passions of a man. Many of his
actions, as detailed by the Grecian poets,
would be regarded by us as very base,
selfish and wicked, and worthy of being
punished by confinement in the penitentiary.
Such is the character of the
chief god, in a system of man’s invention.
Does not this show us that the
religion of the Bible, which reveals to us
a God pure, holy, just and good, is of
divine origin? Does it not also show us
the danger of taking anything for religion,
such as Mormonism and Millerism,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
and all other mythologies which
come from man?</p>

<p>Apollo was the name of several gods,
and this has led to some confusion.
The great Apollo was the son of Jupiter
and Latona. Jupiter’s regular wife was
Juno, a fierce, proud goddess, who hated
Latona, and sent a prodigious serpent,
called Python, to torment her. In order
to protect her, Jupiter raised up a beautiful
island, called Delos, in the sea, to
which Latona retired. Here Apollo was
born, and when he grew up he became
the god of the fine arts, music, poetry,
painting, &amp;c. His adventures, as detailed
by the ancient Greek poets, are
quite interesting.</p>

<div class="divcenterimg60"> 
 <img src="images/i_144.jpg"
 alt="Vulcan and Pluto">
</div><!--end center-->

<p>Vulcan was the god of blacksmiths
and all who wrought by fire in iron.
He was the son of Jupiter and Juno, and
appears to have been so hideous that his
mother was ashamed of him. However,
he seems to have loved his mother—for
on one occasion, she having behaved ill,
Jupiter tied her up. Vulcan, however,
let her loose; for this he paid dearly,
for his father, being greatly incensed,
gave him a tremendous kick, which sent
him out of heaven. He was no less than
nine days and nights in tumbling down
to earth; it is no wonder, then, that he
broke his leg in falling upon the island
of Lemnos, where he alighted. He was
lame ever after.</p>

<p>Pluto was the king of hell, or the regions
which lay beneath the earth. Here
he reigned over his dark, dismal, and
gloomy regions, peopled by the souls of
departed men. Such was his savage
character, and the horrid gloom of his
dominions, that nobody would marry him.
Still, as he wanted a wife, he determined
to have one by hook or by crook. So
one day, as he was driving along in his
chariot, in the island of Sicily, he saw a
beautiful goddess, named Proserpine, surrounded
by her nymphs. Pluto drove up,
seized the lovely deity, and carried her
off. With his trident he opened a passage
in the earth, down which he drove
headlong, and having arrived at home,
Proserpine became queen of hell.</p>

<p>Mercury was the messenger of the
gods, especially of Jupiter. He was also
the patron of travellers and shepherds,
and had a kindness, I am sorry to say
it, for thieves, pickpockets, and rogues
of all kinds. It would seem that such a
god could hardly be respectable; yet I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
believe that he was rather a favorite with
the Greeks.</p>

<div class="divcenterimg60"> 
 <img src="images/i_145ab.jpg"

</div><!--end center-->

<p>Mars was the god of war—a fierce and
terrible god, indeed. Yet, strange to
say, Venus, a handsome goddess, and
wife of the old limping blacksmith, Vulcan,
liked his company very well. Vulcan
made a net of iron links, in which
he caught Mars and Venus, and then
called in all the gods to look at them!
This seems to have made a great deal
of fun.</p>

<p>Hercules was a famous hero, who performed
wonderful exploits, by his bodily
strength alone.</p>

<p>Neptune was the god of the sea. His
father, Saturn, ate him up, when a baby—but
he was afterwards brought to life,
and received his empire from his brother
Jupiter.</p>

<p>Minerva was the goddess of wisdom.
She was said to be born of Jupiter’s brain.
A famous temple was erected to this goddess
at Athens, by Pericles, about four
hundred and fifty years before Christ.
The chief circumstances of her history
were beautifully represented in sculpture
around this temple. The edifice still remains,
though in ruins, a splendid monument
of the genius of the ancient Greeks.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
mythology. For nearly two thousand
years this prevailed in Greece, and it
was afterwards adopted by the Romans,
who added many gods to suit themselves.
It became the Roman religion, and was
inculcated through that vast empire. It
was not till about three hundred and
twenty years after Christ, that the
Christian religion was adopted, as the
religion of the Roman government.</p>

The Elephant.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> elephant, on first view, appears
to be a large mass of unwieldy flesh,
and on further examination, scarcely
gives us any idea but of an animal of
extreme stupidity, with small eyes, large
pendulous ears, and an enormous trunk.
He is generally about ten feet high, but
does sometimes attain the astonishing
height of twelve or fourteen feet. It is
covered with a hide, without hair, which
is hard and callous; it has heavy and misshapen
legs, with round feet, and a tail
with a tuft of hair at the end.</p>

<p>There are two species of the elephant,
the Asiatic and African; they are much
alike, though there is some difference in
the teeth. In Africa, the people never
train the elephant to any useful purposes,
but in Asia this is quite common. In
India, the animal is taught to carry
burdens, and it performs a great deal of
labor. We know that two thousand
years ago elephants were used for war;
this does not appear common now.
They, however, carry large loads, and
often, in hunting tigers, they are very
expert.</p>

<p>Though extensively used, the elephant
is not so domesticated as to breed in its
state of confinement. All those that are
employed by men, are taken when wild,
and trained to their state of servitude.
An elephant will carry three thousand
pounds on his back, which is about six
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
times as much as a horse will carry.
In its natural state it is a mild and
peaceable animal, and will always run
away from a man. It seems to have no
disposition to quarrel even with the brute
creation; and as lions, tigers, and rhinoceroses,
usually let the elephant alone,
he lets them alone.</p>

<p>Though the elephant looks like a
stupid creature, it is in fact very intelligent,
and appears to have some faculties
and sentiments almost human. It delights
in music, and easily learns to beat
time; it is fond of sweet odors, and often
picks flowers, unites them into a nosegay,
and seems delighted with the perfume;
it has a delicacy of touch in its trunk,
like that of the fingers, by which it can
pick up a pin, tie and untie knots, lock
and unlock doors, and even write with a
pen; it learns to love its keeper, whom
it caresses and obeys; it seems gratified
with kindness, and distressed by abuse;
it has even been known to die of grief,
when, in some fit of madness, it has killed
its conductor.</p>

The Lion.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> animal, on account of its fierceness
and strength, called the king of
beasts, is a native of both Asia and Africa.
In countries where it lives, all other
animals fly before it. Wherever man
dwells, he wages war against it, and
finally prevails. The lion is, therefore,
not found where the country is thickly
peopled. But in the vast solitudes of
Africa it is common, and reigns monarch
of all it surveys.</p>

<p>The lion is called cruel, but he only
slays for the purpose of satisfying his
hunger. The wolf, tiger, pole-cat, fox,
will kill only for the sake of killing—even
beyond what they can eat—whereas
the lion, when his appetite is appeased,
will lie down and let animals, upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
which he usually feeds, pass by him unhurt.</p>

<p>There is something very noble in the
aspect of a lion; his head is large, and
his features have a serious and lofty expression.
Though of the cat family, he
has nothing of the sly, insinuating look
of puss.</p>

<p>The strength of the lion is immense.
It is said that he can break the skull of
an ox by a single stroke of his paw. It
is also said that a lion will carry off an
ox that it has killed, dragging it over
hills and ravines and across streams, and
proceeding at long and rapid leaps with
his burthen.</p>

The Gnoo.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> singular animal, which seems to
be between the ox and antelope, was
formerly regarded as a very rare and
strange beast; but of late we have become
better acquainted with it. Several of
these creatures have been exhibited in
the caravans, and beside, many English
travellers have lately been in Africa,
where they are found, and they have
given us many descriptions of them.</p>

<p>They live in herds, like the bisons or
buffaloes of the west, and sometimes hundreds
or thousands of them are seen
scattered over the plains. They are
about as large as our common cattle at
the age of two years; their color is dark
brown; the head and breast are covered
with long shaggy hair, and the horns
bend forward at the base and backwards
at the middle.</p>

<p>They are very timid, and generally fly
from the approach of men. They seem
to be put in a rage by the sight of scarlet.
Mr. Pringle, a traveller in Africa, tells
us some very amusing tales as to this.
When he and his party met with troops
of these creatures, they would hoist a red
handkerchief on a pole. At this the gnoos
would approach, tear up the ground, lash
their sides with their tails, and show
signs of violent rage, and then they
would suddenly bound away to a distance.</p>

A Swedish Girl.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gustavus</span> <abbr title="Three"><span class="smcap">III.</span></abbr>, king of Sweden, passing
one morning on horseback through
a village in the neighborhood of his capital,
observed a young peasant girl, of
interesting appearance, drawing water at
a fountain by the way-side. He went
up to her, and asked her for a draught.
Without delay, she lifted up her pitcher,
and with artless simplicity put it to the
lips of the monarch. Having satisfied
his thirst, and courteously thanked his
benefactress, he <span class="lock">said:—</span></p>

<p>“My girl, if you would accompany
me to Stockholm, I would endeavor to
fix you in a more agreeable situation.”</p>

<p>“Ah, sir,” replied the girl, “I cannot
accept your proposal. I am not anxious
to rise above the state of life in which
the providence of God has placed me;
but even if I were, I could not for an
instant hesitate.”</p>

<p>“And why?” rejoined the king, somewhat
surprised.</p>

<p>“Because,” answered the girl, “my
mother is poor and sickly, and has no
one but me to assist or comfort her
under many afflictions; and no earthly
bribe could induce me to leave her, or
to neglect the duties which affection
requires from me.”</p>

<p>“Where is your mother?” asked the
monarch.</p>

<p>“In that little cabin,” replied the girl,
pointing to a wretched hovel beside her.</p>

<p>The king, whose feelings were interested
in his companion, went in, and
beheld, stretched on a bedstead, whose
only covering was a little straw, an aged
female, weighed down with years, and
sinking under infirmities. Moved at the
sight, the monarch addressed her: “I am
sorry, my poor woman, to find you in so
destitute and afflicted a condition.”</p>

<p>“Alas! sir,” said the venerable sufferer,
“I should indeed be an object of
pity, had I not that kind and attentive
girl, who labors to support me, and omits
nothing she thinks can afford me relief.
May a gracious God remember it to her
for good,” she added, wiping away a
tear.</p>

<p>Never, perhaps, was Gustavus more
sensible than at that moment of the pleasure
of occupying an exalted station.
The gratification arising from the consciousness
of having it in his power to
assist a fellow-creature, almost overpowered
him; and putting a purse into the
hand of the young villager, he could only
say, “Continue to take care of your
mother; I shall soon enable you to do
so more effectually. Good-bye, my amiable
girl; you may depend on the promise
of your king.”</p>

<p>On his return to Stockholm, Gustavus
settled a pension for life on the mother,
with the reversion to her daughter at
her death.</p>

<h2>
The Story of “Gander.”<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us understand each other at the
outset, gentle reader. <span class="smcap">Gander</span>, as you
will suppose, was not a <em>goose</em>; but you
will be surprised to hear that he was a
“<em>horse</em>.” Why the creature got this
name, I cannot tell, unless it was that he
was <em>white</em>, and was always a leader among
the horses. But, however the name
originated, the following is a true story
of him, as told to me by a gentleman of
veracity.</p>

<p>In the year 1825, on a summer’s day,
my friend left the vicinity of the Dunderberg
mountain, in Rockland county,
in the state of New York, with this and
another horse, for a town on the Connecticut
river. The other horse was <em>bay</em>,
small, old, lean, and of a submissive
aspect; while Gander, as I said before,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
was <em>white</em>, and, although somewhat advanced
in years, was large, well-built,
and quite proud in his bearing. These
horses, together with a wagon, my friend
had taken of a doubtful debtor, and at
the above time left the vicinity of the
Dunderberg, as I said, for his home, some
hundred miles to the east.</p>

<p>For two reasons “Bay” was doomed
to be the drudge on the journey. One
was, that Gander and the wagon did not
agree; the other was, that my friend
chose to give him an easy journey, for
the purpose of more readily converting
him into cash on his reaching home.
Gander, therefore, was tied behind.</p>

<p>“Matters being thus arranged,” my
friend proceeded, “we commenced our
journey; but we were destined not long
thus to be linked together; for although
Gander appeared to recognise his new
master, he liked not the compulsory
method I had taken to assure myself of
his company. A single toss of his head
was sufficient to break his halter, and he
seemed to understand this snapping process
to perfection; but, then, instead of
running away, and thus securing for a
time his freedom, he would stand still,
quietly waiting for me to dismount and
again attach him to his post.</p>

<p>“His late master had been abundant
in commendation of his sagacity and
other notable qualities, but assured me
he would not be led. Not being inclined,
however, to yield my belief without a
trial, I had tied him, as above noticed.
We had not proceeded far, however,
before Gander gave intimation that <em>indeed</em>
‘he would not be led.’ Snap went the
halter, again. With much good nature, I
again tied it, but with precisely the same
result. At length, it was quite plain the
animal was willing to acknowledge his
allegiance to his new master, although
he had not been consulted in the transfer;
but his submission must be <em>voluntary</em>—he
would not be led like a criminal,
especially with a halter about his
neck.</p>

<p>“The rope was soon useless; and now
necessity became the mother of invention.
I slipped the remnant of the halter
from his head, jumped into my wagon,
and drove on. This movement seemed
quite satisfactory to the hitherto disobliged
animal; and from his future conduct,
it was evident he had obtained his
wishes. Immediately he came to the
side of the vehicle;—afterwards he chose
‘Bay,’ for a time, as his companion; and
thus, side by side, and cheek-by-jowl,
with either drudge or master, he jogged
on for an hour or two. Finally, however,
he fell back to the rear of the wagon,
and, singular as it may appear, he kept
this spot to the end of his journey, with,
perhaps, a single exception, which I shall
by-and-by mention; excepting, also, that
occasionally he turned upon the road-side,
while ascending a hill, to crop a
tuft of green grass. At such times, if
for a moment he forgot his master till he
had disappeared, in a few minutes more
his shrill voice was heard, and he recovered
his post behind, with all expedition.</p>

<p>“On the morning of the second day, we
left Newburgh, and crossing the Hudson
at Poughkeepsie, directed our course to
Litchfield, in Connecticut. I had not
travelled fast, however, and it was quite
dusk, when I arrived at the foot of Mount
Tom, within eight or ten miles of the
end of my journey for the day. I had
observed a few heavy clouds in the west,
and now these were approaching and
increasing with so great rapidity, that I
had scarce a hope of escaping the impending
storm. I was entirely unacquainted
with the road over the mountain,
but it was a long distance to any
shelter which I had passed. I determined,
therefore, to push forward.</p>

<p>“Had ‘Bay’ possessed my fears, I
should have had some hope of escaping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
from the storm; but he was, of the two,
the greater philosopher. The distant
thunder had no terrors for him; besides,
it was an up-hill journey, and this, instead
of increasing his energy, seemed to be a
good reason for abating his exertions.
Consequently, before we had gained half
the distance to the summit of the mountain,
darkness was upon us; ominous
drops of rain were beginning to fall, and
the thunder was rolling overhead.</p>

<p>“In this dilemma, although sometimes
aided by a flash of lightning, my situation
became almost appalling. However,
when it was impossible to see the road,
I left my wagon, and, after feeling and
ascertaining the way a few rods, I managed
to guide my horse a short distance.
This plan I had repeated several times,
and was at the last returning to start
again, when Gander, whom before I had
scarcely thought of for an hour, advanced
from his post, and planted himself immediately
in front of ‘Bay.’ This extraordinary
movement of the animal, (for he
had only once before taken precedence
on our journey,) was so very singular,
that it at once occurred to me he had
some good motive for it. His color was
<em>white</em>; did his sagacity teach him that
‘Bay’ could see <em>him</em>, if not the road?
Was his sight more keen than my own,
and did he discover it? Did his instinct
teach him that his color might render
him conspicuous, even in darkness, so
that we could follow him? Can this be
called instinct, or was it <em>reason</em>? Let
it be called by whatever name it may, I
had before heard of the sagacity of the
horse, but I was now to witness it.</p>

<p>“I again seated myself in my wagon,
by which time the rain fell in torrents.
Gander was not discoverable from my
seat when we started, but I drove on.
‘Bay’ now showed less reluctance, and,
encouraged by his pioneer, moved forward
more rapidly; we soon gained the
mountain-top, and the frequent flashes
of lightning showed Gander still in his
new position, a foot or two in advance
of Bay, and in the very centre of the
road. Soon after our descent of the
mountain commenced, it became so light,
that I could just discern my leader; and
thus we jogged on for some time, till at
length a light was visible in the distance.
I had scarcely discovered it,
when a shrill neigh from Gander announced
his pleasure at the prospect.
He guided me safely to it, and to the door
of an inn, as it proved, in Bradleyville.
I need hardly add, that Gander received,
not only the hearty caresses of his master,
but an extra quantity of delicacies
for his supper, good attendance, and a
bundle or two of straw for his bed. He
should have had a mattress, had he preferred
it.”</p>

<h2>
The Dog of Montargis.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is in France a castle by the
name of Montargis. In the hall of this
castle there is a sculpture which represents
a dog fighting with a champion.
The story connected with this sculpture
is as <span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

<p>Aubri de Mondidier, a gentleman of
family and fortune, travelling alone
through the Forest of Bondi, was murdered,
and buried under a tree. His
dog, an English blood-hound, would not
quit his master’s grave for several days;
till, at length, compelled by hunger, he
proceeded to the house of an intimate
friend of the unfortunate Aubri’s, at Paris,
and by his melancholy howling, seemed
desirous of expressing the loss they had
both sustained. He repeated his cries,
ran to the door, looked back to see if any
one followed him, returned to his master’s
friend, pulled him by the sleeve,
and with dumb eloquence entreated him
to go with him.</p>

<p>The singularity of all these actions of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
the dog, added to the circumstance of his
coming there without his master, whose
faithful companion he had always been,
prompted the company to follow the animal,
who conducted them to a tree, where
he renewed his howl, scratching the earth
with his feet, and significantly entreating
them to search that particular spot. Accordingly,
on digging, the body of the
unfortunate Aubri was found.</p>

<p>Some time after, the dog accidentally
met the assassin, who is styled, by the
historians, Chevalier Macaire; when, instantly
seizing him by the throat, he was
with great difficulty compelled to quit
his prey. In short, whenever the dog
saw the Chevalier, he continued to pursue
and attack him with equal fury.
Such obstinate virulence in the animal,
confined only to Macaire, appeared very
extraordinary; especially to those who
at once recollected the dog’s remarkable
attachment to his master, and several
instances in which Macaire’s envy and
hatred to Aubri de Mondidier had been
conspicuous.</p>

<p>Additional circumstances created suspicion;
and at length the affair reached
the royal ear. The king, Louis <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>,
accordingly sent for the dog, who appeared
extremely gentle, till he perceived
Macaire in the midst of several noblemen,
when he ran fiercely towards him, growling,
and attacking him as usual.</p>

<p>The king, struck with these circumstantial
evidences against Macaire, determined
to refer the decision to the chance
of battle; in other words, he gave orders
for a combat between the Chevalier and
the dog. The lists were appointed in
the Isle of Notre Dame, then an unenclosed,
uninhabited place, and Macaire
was allowed for his weapon a great
cudgel.</p>

<p>An empty cask was given to the dog
as a place of retreat, to enable him to
recover breath. Everything being prepared,
the dog no sooner found himself
at liberty, than he ran round his adversary,
avoiding his blows, and menacing
him on every side, till his strength was
exhausted; then, springing forward, he
griped him by the throat, threw him on
the ground, and obliged him to confess
his guilt, in the presence of the king and
the whole court. In consequence of this,
the Chevalier, after a few days, was convicted
upon his own acknowledgment,
and beheaded on a scaffold in the Isle
of Notre Dame.</p>

Natural Lamps.<br>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> queen beetle is about one inch
and a quarter in length, and carries
by her side, just about her waist, two
brilliant lamps, which she lights up at
pleasure, with the solar phosphorus furnished
her by nature. These little lamps
do not flash and glimmer like those of
the fire-fly, but give as steady a light as
that produced by a gas-burner, exhibiting
two perfect spheres, as large as a minute
pearl. These are so powerful that they
will afford a person light enough to read
print by them.</p>

<p>On carrying this insect into a dark
closet in the daytime, no light is emitted
at first, but she quickly illuminates her
lamps, and immediately extinguishes
them, on being brought again into the
light. But language cannot sufficiently
express the beauty and sublimity of these
lucid orbs in miniature, with which nature
has endowed the queen of the insect

<h2 class="no-break">
The School-Ma’am.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one of his little books, Peter Parley
has told us how Aunt Delight taught
him his letters; and I believe that I have
given some account of the early lessons
that I, Robert Merry, received from Miss
Sally <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John.</p>

<p>In old times, children were generally
taught their a-b-c, by some good old
woman, who was called the “School-ma’am.”
Above is a picture of one of
these dames, giving a first lesson to a
child. How hard the little fellow tries
to say his letters! A man laying stone
wall, does not make a greater effort.</p>

<p>I have told my readers of some of the
pranks of the friend and playmate of my
early days, Bill Keeler; but there is one
which I have not yet told. It was as
<span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

<p>You should know that Sally <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John,
the school-ma’am, having no husband,
made a great pet of her cat. This was
named Nip, and, strange to say, he used
regularly to go with her to school.</p>

<p>Many a child had a “box with five nails
in it,” for playing some trick upon Nip,
but this was especially the case with Bill.
He was always getting into some trouble
on account of the cat.</p>

<p>Now Bill had a great love for gunpowder;
and of all things, he delighted
in what is called a <em>witch-quill</em>. This is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
made of a quill, filled with layers of wet
and dry powder: when set on fire, the
quill goes jumping about, hither and
thither, all the time spouting forth a stream
of fire.</p>

<p>On one occasion he carried one of
these to school, and when Aunt Sally’s
back was turned, he gave it a toss into
the fire. In an instant the quill was
lighted, and, starting from the fire-place,
darted directly under the school mistress’s
chair. Pop—fizz! pop—fizz! it went.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that Nip was under
Aunt Sally’s chair at that very moment.
He was fast asleep, when the wicked
witch-quill popped in, taking its station
exactly under his nose. Never was there
such horror, as appeared in Nip’s countenance.
He stuck up his back, drew
his tail out at full length, set apart his
jaws, and with glaring eyes gazed at the
terrible monster.</p>

<p>The comet that has lately been seen
in the sky, with a tail ninety millions
of miles in length, never scared any poor
Millerite half so much as did Bill Keeler’s
witch-quill, Aunt Sally’s cat. Nip
didn’t know at all what to make of it.
He had seen squirrels with long tails,—rats,
moles, bats, owls, and other strange
things,—but never, in all his days, had he
beheld anything that spouted forth fire—real
fire—before.</p>

<p>After gazing at the witch a few seconds,
Nip mustered all his courage, spit
at it, and gave it a thump with his paw.
Fizz—pop! went the quill! Nip’s courage
was exhausted—and he ran away
with all his might. Strange to say, at
that moment the quill started, and shot
along the floor, in the exact direction
puss had taken.</p>

<p>It stopped, however, about the middle
of the school-room floor, and then it began
to whirl round, popping, spinning,
and fizzing, in a most wonderful style.
“What on airth is that?” said Aunt
Sally. “Oh dear!” “Oh dear!” “Oh
dear!” said a dozen children at once.</p>

<p>“Oh! it’s Bill Keeler! it’s Bill Keeler!”
said the school mistress—knowing
by instinct where all mischief came from.
“Oh dear, I’m shot! I’m popped! I’m
fizzed! I’m bewitched! Oh! Bill, Bill,
you’ll be the death of me!”</p>

<p>All this time, the wicked witch-quill
was spinning and spouting about, in the
middle of the floor. The children
shrieked, and Bill Keeler laughed as if
his sides would split. At last, the witch-quill,
with a dying effort, hissed along
the floor, and went straight at Nip, who
had got beneath a writing bench. With
a horrid yell, the cat fled, and leaping
upon Aunt Sally’s shoulder, hung on to
the flesh with all her claws. The good
woman shook and pulled, but Nip held
the tighter for all that; and Bill, seeing
that things were getting serious, took
his hat and ran.</p>

<p class="center">
<i>A Story about the Beetles.</i><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day, as Jack was going along in
the field, he saw a dead mole lying upon
the ground. He took it up, and admired
its soft fur, and the rays upon its nose,
making it look, in shape, like a star. He
looked, also, very carefully to see if it
had eyes, for he had been told that moles
were blind.</p>

<p>After looking all over the head of the
mole, Jack at last discovered two little
eyes, as black and shining as beads, very
near the creature’s nose. They were
deeply hidden in the fur, and for this
reason it is that people say that a mole
is blind. Jack, by investigating for himself,
discovered the truth, which is, that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
moles have eyes. The reason for having
their eyes so small, and so imbedded in
fur, is this,—they live under ground, and
dig a great deal in the earth; it is therefore
very well that they have little eyes,
sheltered with fur, so that the dirt may
not get into them.</p>

<div class="divcenterimg60"> 
 <img src="images/i_156.jpg"
 alt="Moles">
 <p class="caption"><i>Moles.</i></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Having examined the mole some time,
Jack threw it down, and went along.
About two or three hours afterwards, he
was coming back the same way. As he
was passing the dead mole, he noticed
that it appeared to be sunk in the ground.
He stopped, and looked at it attentively.
Pretty soon he saw a large black bug,
which we call a beetle, creep from under
it, and run around it.</p>

<p>This attracted Jack’s attention, and
kneeling down, he watched carefully to
see what was going on. After looking
about a little, he noticed that there were
four or five beetles, all at work, digging
a hole under the mole, into which the
creature was gradually sinking.</p>

<p>He lifted up the mole a little, so that
he might observe them more carefully;
but the creatures did not seem to mind
him. They went to work again, immediately,
digging away the earth, which
they threw out at the sides. It was
amusing to see how hard they toiled.</p>

<p>The heads of the beetles were shaped
somewhat like a spade. With these they
dug up the earth, and then clawed it away
with their feet. Never did a set of men,
digging a cellar, appear more active,
busy and efficient.</p>

<p>Jack had always before hated beetles,
as being ugly, disagreeable things; but
now he was delighted to see them. He
immediately ran off to get his aunt Piper
to come and observe what was going
on. She was very busy, but Jack persuaded
her to go with him.</p>

<p>They soon came to the spot, and aunt
Betsey now saw that what Jack had told
her was all true. The beetles were,
indeed, burying the mole. “But what
are they doing it for?—are they sextons?”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“They are called <em>burying beetles</em>,”
said the aunt; “but, Jack, I shall leave
you to find out yourself what they are
burying the mole for.” So, after a time,
Jack and his aunt went away. The next
day Jack went to the place, when, behold,
the mole was not to be seen! There
was a little spot of fresh earth where it
had lain, but that was all.</p>

<p>“So,” thought Jack to himself, “so,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
neighbor beetles, I guess you have buried
the mole,—at any rate, we will see.”
So Jack began to dig away the earth a
little, with his fingers, and about two
inches below the surface, there was the
mole, sure enough. The beetles were
all around the carcass, and every one of
them was at work, making a feast. Jack
covered up the hole, and left them all to
themselves.</p>

The Little Flower Girl.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> beautiful is Spring! See this
little girl—she has gone forth into the
fields alone, and she has gathered a handful
of blossoms—dandelions, buttercups,
and pansies.</p>

<p>Why should the little girl gather flowers?
Because they are beautiful, you
will tell me. And who told you they
were beautiful? You cannot tell me
that, perhaps; then I will tell you.</p>

<p>It is God, who made us, that has told
us flowers are beautiful. He made us
with eyes to see, and hearts to feel their
beauty. He made these things, and He
formed us so that we might love them,
and take pleasure in them. How good
and kind is it of our Heavenly Father,
to spread pleasant things around us, and
give us faculties to enjoy them!</p>

<p>Surely, when we see so many lovely
blossoms, and so many pleasant things,
scattered around us, we should think
with gratitude of Him who has arranged
all these things; and our hearts being
filled with love to Him, we should all try
to please Him, by doing as He wishes
us to do.</p>

<p>God has done other kind things for
us—He has not only made flowers, but
He has made truth, charity, kindness,
goodness, and other things, which are
called virtues. God looks on these things,
as we do upon flowers, as very lovely
things; and what he wishes of us, is, that
our hearts shall be full of these virtues.
He likes to look on a virtuous mind, as
we do on a flowery garden.</p>

<p>Now, my little reader, you can love
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
these virtues, if you please, and you can
adorn yourself with them. When you
have learned to love them, it will give
you great pleasure to think of them, and
if they dwell in your own heart, you will
be happy indeed. If you love truth, if
you love charity and kindness, if you are
fond of everything that is good and amiable,
then God will love you, and you
will be cheerful and happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a far-off country, there was once a
jeweller who left home with some valuable
diamonds, for the purpose of selling
them in a city at some distance from his
own residence. He took with him his
son and a slave. This slave he had
purchased when quite a small boy, and
had brought him up more like an adopted
child than a servant.</p>

<p>The merchant at length reached the
city whither he was going, and disposed
of his diamonds with great advantage.
While preparing to return home he was
seized with a sudden illness, which in a
few hours terminated his life. The
merchant was quite a stranger in the
city. This his servant knew, and believing
himself quite safe, he declared
himself to be the son of the deceased
jeweller, and entitled to take charge of
his property.</p>

<p>The real son was filled with great
grief, but what could he do? He had
no means of establishing his right to the
property, for he had no means of proving
himself to be the son of the deceased.
The servant was loud in his pretensions,
and one circumstance served to favor his
claims. He was a young man, quite
comely in his person, and polished in his
manners; whereas the jeweller’s son was
mean in his appearance, and had been
seriously injured in his education by the
indulgence of his parents. It was, therefore,
quite natural that strangers should
take part with the servant against the son.</p>

<p>At length, in order to end the dispute,
the latter referred the matter to a court
of law. There, however, from a total
want of proof, nothing could be decided.
Each party was equally positive, but
neither could do more than to assert his
claim. At length the judge declared his
utter inability to determine which was
the rightful heir to the property.</p>

<p>The novelty of the case, and the great
amount of property in question, excited
the interest and curiosity of a large part
of the city. Divers opinions prevailed,
and the subject became a fruitful theme
of conversation and dispute. It was
thought to be a case of so much importance
as to merit the attention of the
prince of the country.</p>

<p>The case was accordingly stated to
him; but in like manner he also was
confounded, and at a loss how to decide
the question. At length a happy thought
occurred to the chief judge of the prince,
by which to ascertain the real heir. The
two claimants were summoned before
him. He ordered them to stand behind
a curtain prepared for the occasion.
Through this curtain two openings were
made. They were directed to project
their heads through these holes, and then
each one might tell his story. When the
judge had heard them he was to decide
the case, and cut off the head of the one
whom he should judge to be the slave.</p>

<p>Both agreed to the plan; the son
relying upon the honesty and the justice
of his cause; the servant, through his confidence
in the impossibility of detection.</p>

<p>The judge took his seat, and the
parties took their stations. An officer
with a drawn sword stood in front ready
to strike off the head of the one whom the
judge should decide to be the impostor.</p>

<p>They now told their stories. Just as
the last one had finished, the judge cried
out in a stern voice to the officer,
“Enough! Enough! strike off the villain’s
head!” The officer sprung towards
the young men with an uplifted sword.
The impostor, conscious of his guilt,
started back behind the curtain; the son,
conscious of the justice of his cause,
stood unmoved!</p>

<p>The judge immediately decided for the
latter, ordered the property to be given to
him, and the slave to be punished for his
wicked and ungrateful attempt at deception.</p>

Louisa Vinning.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> little artist of nature, who has
recently excited the astonishment of the
musical world, and claims the admiration
of all, as a remarkable instance of
precocious powers, was born on the 10th
Nov., 1836, at Kingsbridge, Devonshire,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
England. Her father, John Vinning, is
a musician of talent: as violinist and
composer, he has acquired celebrity.
His two brothers are also musicians,
having been induced, by an irresistible
inclination for music, to abandon the
professions to which they had been bred.</p>

<p>When the little warbler who is now
the subject of notice, had reached the
age of nine months, it was observed that
she derived intense delight from music;
and if she was ever fretful, the sound of
her father’s violin immediately soothed
her; at the same time her whole frame
would move in unison with the measure,
and her face beam with ecstasy. Her
father indulged the child in occasionally
playing to her, but the excitement was
so intense that he became apprehensive
it might injure her. He accordingly
took the advice of several medical men,
who recommended a moderate indulgence
only of the child’s passion.</p>

<p>Before Louisa could speak words, she
began to sing tunes with accuracy and
effect; and often while asleep, she would
warble forth some soft and sweet melody,—an
air she had heard, or the impromptu
suggestion of a dream. On
one occasion the father was called by the
mother, whom he found in tears by the
bed-side of the sleeping child, who was
singing a beautiful air, in a soft and
mellow voice. The father remained at
the place, and the little warbler repeated
it several times. He immediately took
a pen and wrote it down. This song
was sold to Mr. Burkley, of London,
who wrote some lines to it, and it was
published under the title of the “Infant’s
Dream.” This composition has been
much admired. In the morning after
the child had sung this song in her
sleep, she said to her mother, “Oh, I
have seen such beautiful angels in my
sleep—all gold—beautiful gold!”</p>

<p>When this interesting prodigy was
two years old, she was announced to
sing in public in London. Her performances
were such as to excite the utmost
wonder, even of musicians of the highest
standing. The celebrated Thalberg,
then in London, Sir G. Smart, and the
Misses Moschelles, stated that her singing
was astonishingly correct, her voice
pleasing and of great compass, her ear
correct, and her feeling quick and deep.
Such was her fame, at this age, that the
queen sent for her to come to Buckingham
palace. On hearing the child sing,
her majesty was so touched, that she
clasped her warmly to her breast, and
afterwards placed a large diamond pin in
her bosom, as an expression of her delight.</p>

<p>From this time, this little singer continued
to attract public attention, and
promises, when she arrives at maturity,
fully to realize the hopes her early displays
and genius have inspired.</p>

<h2>
Importance of a Fly.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following facts may give our readers
some idea of the vast importance to
the British treasury of a little insect,
called the hop fly, or <i lang="la">Aphis Humelia</i>.</p>

<p>In the year 1822, on the 14th of May,
the hop duty, on a fair estimate, according
to the prospect of the crop, was laid
at £100,000; the fly, however, appearing
pretty plentifully towards the end of
the month, it was estimated as likely to
produce only £80,000. The fly increased,
and by the end of June the duty had
gone down to £60,000; by the end of
July, to £30,000; by the end of August,
to £22,000, and by the end of December
to £14,000. The duty actually paid this
year was £15,463 10<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></p>

<p>In 1825, the duty commenced at an
estimate of £130,000; but, owing to the
excessive increase of the fly, it had in
July fallen to £16,000; at the beginning
of September it rose to £29,000, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
towards the end fell again to £22,000.
The amount paid was £24,317 0<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 11<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr></p>

<p>In the following year, the summer was
remarkably dry and hot; the thermometer
for several nights continued above
seventy degrees all the night through.
The crop of hops was immense; scarcely
a fly was to be found, and the duty,
which was estimated in May at £120,000,
rose to £265,000, and the amount
actually paid was £262,331 0<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 9<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>, being
the largest amount ever known.</p>

<p>From this, it will appear, that in duty
alone, a little insignificant-looking fly
has a control over £150,000, or 700,000
dollars, annual income to the British
treasury! Supposing the hop grounds
of England capable of paying this latter
duty annually, which they certainly are,
it is very manifest that in 1825 these
creatures were the means of robbing the
treasury of over £100,000; this seems
a large sum, but it is only a small part
of the amount actually destroyed, for we
here only speak of the tax, and not of
the entire value of the hops destroyed.
This, no doubt, is three times as much
as we have estimated, for the duty alone.
In some years it is probable that the hop
fly destroys hops in England to the value
of nearly two millions of dollars! Is
not this driving business on a large scale?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> first month of summer is said to
derive its name from Juno, a Roman
goddess, in honor of whom a festival
was celebrated at the beginning of the
month: its zodiacal sign is Cancer,

is now fully established, and even
in New England the grumblers say
nothing of easterly winds, and confess
that it is warm enough. In the southern
states, the people are beginning to fear
the return of fevers; beside, the days

therefore, those who can leave home

A Chapter of English Kings.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1041, the Danes were
finally driven out of England, and for a
short space the Saxon kings were restored
to the throne. The last of these, Harold,
was defeated by <em>William, Duke of Normandy</em>,
or <em>William the Conqueror</em>, in
the celebrated battle of Hastings, in the
year 1066.</p>

<p>This decided the fate of England:
Harold was killed upon the field, and the
Norman line of kings succeeded to the
throne. William reigned about twenty
years. He was an able warrior, but he
ruled with great severity.</p>

<p>He divided the lands of the nobility
of England among his followers, and
oppressed the people by rigorous laws.
They therefore held meetings to devise
plots of rebellion, usually in the evening.
To suppress them, he ordered a bell to
be rung every evening at eight o’clock,
at which time they were required to put
out their fires and lights. This was
called the <i lang="fr">couvre feu</i>,—French words,
signifying <em>cover fire</em>: it is from this that
the word curfew has come, which now
means, the bell rung at evening, about
the time for the people to go to bed.</p>

<p>William endeavored to make the English
people live like Frenchmen; he
required the French language to be used
in the courts of law, and it was spoken
by himself and all around the palace.</p>

<p>William took pains to make his new
kingdom thrive; he had a careful survey
made of the lands and property, and these
were registered in a book called the
Dooms-day book, copies of which are
still preserved.</p>

<p>During William’s reign, the laws were
firmly established, and a great deal was
done to benefit the people. He was at
first hated as a conqueror and oppressor,
but he was finally regarded as a sagacious,
though severe king. He died at Rouen,
in France, 1087, aged 63 years.
</p>

<p><i>William Rufus</i>, or William the Red,
the second son of the Conqueror, succeeded
his father; he was addicted to
field sports, and one day, while pursuing
a deer in the forest, he was killed by an
arrow, discharged by Walter Tyrrel.
The arrow first hit a tree, but it glanced,
and struck the king in the breast. This
occurred in the year 1100.</p>

<p><i>Henry First</i>, the third son of the Conqueror,
succeeded. He was very despotic,
but still he sought to promote the
prosperity of his kingdom. He patronised
learning, restored the University of
Cambridge, and received the title of
<em>Beau Clerk</em>, which implies that he was
a good scholar. He punished robbers,
who were very numerous in his day,
with severity; he abolished the hated
curfew, established a uniform standard
of weights and measures, and granted
charters of various kinds, which were
the first beginnings of English liberty.
He died in Normandy, 1135.</p>

<p><i>Stephen</i> usurped the throne which
Henry had bequeathed to his daughter,
Matilda, in 1135. After a disturbed
reign of nineteen years, Stephen died in
1154, and was succeeded by <i>Henry <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></i>,
son of Matilda. He held the kingdom
of Brittany, in France, and conquered
Ireland, which has ever since been attached
to the British crown.</p>

<p>He was a wise prince, but he had great
trouble with the clergy. Thomas á
Becket, the primate of England, who was
thought to be disposed greatly to extend
his power, was murdered by some persons
in the cathedral of Canterbury.
This crime was laid to King Henry, and
he was obliged, by the Pope of Rome, to
take a solemn oath that he had nothing
to do with it, in order to clear himself.
He was also obliged to walk barefoot to
the tomb of Becket, and to yield to various
penances, imposed by the monks of
Canterbury. He was severely whipped
with rods by the monks, during his penance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
and to this he patiently submitted.
He died 1189.</p>

<p><i>Richard the Lion-Hearted</i>, his son,
succeeded him, and was crowned 1189.
He was a man of great bodily strength,
of invincible courage, and possessed
many generous qualities. He was seized
with the mania of the age, to go and
fight against the Turks for the recovery
of Jerusalem. In Palestine, he performed
prodigies of valor, and on his way back,
was taken and imprisoned by the Duke
of Austria. He was released after some
years, his people paying a heavy ransom.
He was afterwards shot by a cross-bow,
while besieging a castle in Normandy.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his brother <i>John</i>,
who was so poor as to get the surname
of <i>Lackland</i>. John was a weak, vicious
king; but one good thing happened during
his reign. He signed a paper, called
<em>Magna Charta</em>, or <em>Great Charter</em>, in
which he yielded some portion of the
despotic power before claimed by the
kings of England. This was a serious
abridgement of the king’s authority, and
it opened the way for still further enlarging
the liberties of the people. He died
in 1216.</p>

<p><i>Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></i>, though but nine years
old, succeeded his father John, and
reigned fifty-five years. He was a weak
and vicious king, and the people took
advantage of his folly and weakness, to
extort from the crown various concessions,
which extended and secured their
liberties.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his son <i>Edward</i>,
in 1272, called <i>Longshanks</i>, on account
of his uncommonly long legs. He was
a famous warrior, and conquered Wales.
He made war upon Scotland, and was
bravely resisted by the famous William
Wallace. While marching with a great
army against Robert Bruce, who headed
the Scotch, he died, and his son, <i>Edward
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></i>, succeeded him in 1307. He led an
army of 100,000 men against Scotland,

but was defeated with vast slaughter, in
the celebrated battle of Bannockburn.
He was a foolish king, and his own wife
imprisoned him, and caused him to be
murdered.</p>

<p>His son, <i>Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></i>, began to reign
in 1327, at the age of eighteen. He was
a brave warrior, and beat the Scotch and
the French. His son, the celebrated Black
Prince, was not less renowned as a warrior,
while he was also distinguished for
his kindness and generosity. This prince
died 1376, and his father the year after.</p>

<p><i>Richard <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></i>, grandson of Edward <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>,
came to the throne in 1377, being only
eleven years old. During his reign,
there was a famous rebellion, the leader
of which was Walter Tyler, a blacksmith.
Walter, in a conference with the
king, was so insolent, that William Walworth
knocked him down with a club,
and one of the soldiers despatched him.</p>

<p>Richard was deposed by the duke of
Lancaster, and being imprisoned, was
either killed or starved to death. The
Duke was crowned king in 1400, under
the title of <i>Henry <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr></i> It was during
his reign, that the wars of <em>the two roses</em>
took place; that is, the war between the
houses of York and Lancaster. Their
partisans were distinguished, the one by
red, the other by white roses. He died
1413, aged forty-six, and was succeeded
by his son, Henry <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr></p>

of English Kings, in a future number.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir Christopher Wren.</span>—When this
eminent architect was building <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s
cathedral, he caused the following notice
to be affixed to several parts of the structure.
“Whereas, among laborers and
others, that ungodly custom of swearing
is so frequently heard, to the dishonor
of God and contempt of his authority;
and to the end that such impiety may
be utterly banished from these works,
which are intended for the service of
God and the honor of religion: it is
ordered, that profane swearing shall be a
sufficient crime to dismiss any laborer
that comes to the call; and the clerk of
the works, upon a sufficient proof, shall
dismiss him accordingly: and that if
any master, working by task, shall not,
upon admonition, reform the profanation
among his apprentices, servants, and
laborers, it shall be construed his fault,
and he shall be liable to be censured by
the commissioners.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Madame de Genlis.</span>—Madame de
Genlis relates the following anecdote,
which occurred during her residence at
<span class="lock">Berlin:—</span></p>

<p>“My saloon had two doors, one opening
into my chamber, and the other conducting
to a private staircase, descending to
the court. On the platform of this staircase
was a door opposite to mine, belonging
to the apartments of an emigrant.
This man was of a savage disposition,
and never saw any one in the house.
Some one had given me two pots of
beautiful hyacinths; at night I placed
them on this platform, between my neighbor’s
door and my own. In the morning,
I went to take them again, and had the
disagreeable surprise to see my beautiful
hyacinths cut into pieces, and scattered
round the pots which held them. I
easily guessed that my neighbor was the
author of this deed, who had been excited
to it, doubtless, notwithstanding his
French politeness, by the libels which
were published against me. Not wishing
the affair to be known, I did not ask
more flowers of the persons who had
given me these, but directed a servant
to buy me some. Having placed these
in the pots, I attached to them a slip of
paper, on which I wrote these words:—‘Destroy
my works, if you will, but
respect the works of God.’ At night I
placed them on the platform: in the morning
I went with eagerness to see what had
been their fate, and saw with great pleasure
that some one had been content with
simply watering them. I carried them
immediately into the saloon, and placing
them on the table, perceived that there
were attached to them two silk strings,
each suspending a cornelian ring.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">A Gentleman in America.</span>—“A man
of my acquaintance,” says Dr. Dwight,
“who was of a vehement and rigid temper,
had, many years since, a dispute with
a friend of his, a professor of religion,
and had been injured by him. With
strong feelings of resentment, he made
him a visit, for the avowed purpose of
quarrelling with him. He accordingly
stated the nature and extent of the injury;
and was preparing, as he afterwards
confessed, to load him with a train of
severe reproaches, when his friend cut
him short by acknowledging, with the
utmost readiness and frankness, the injustice
of which he had been guilty;
expressing his own regret for the wrong
he had done, requesting his forgiveness,
and proffering him ample compensation.
He was compelled to say that he was
satisfied, and withdrew full of mortification
that he had been precluded from
venting his indignation and wounding
his friend with keen and violent reproaches
for his conduct.</p>

<p>“As he was walking homeward, he
said to himself to this effect: ‘There
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
must be something more in religion than
I have hitherto suspected. Were any
man to address me in the tone of haughtiness
and provocation with which I
accosted my friend this morning, it would
be impossible for me to preserve the
equanimity of which I have been a witness;
and especially with so much frankness,
humility and meekness, to acknowledge
the wrong which I had done; so
readily ask forgiveness of the man whom
I had injured; and so cheerfully promise
a satisfactory recompense. I should
have met his anger with at least equal
resentment, paid him reproach for reproach,
and inflicted wound for wound.
There is something in this man’s disposition
which is not mine. There is
something in the religion which he professes,
and which I am forced to believe
he feels; something which makes him
so superior, so much better, so much
more amiable, than I can pretend to be.
The subject strikes me in a manner to
which I have hitherto been a stranger.
It is high time to examine it more thoroughly,
with more candor, and with
greater solicitude, also, than I have done
hitherto.’</p>

<p>“From this incident, a train of thoughts
and emotions commenced in the mind
of this man, which terminated in his
profession of the Christian religion, his
relinquishment of the business in which
he was engaged, and his consecration of
himself to the ministry of the gospel.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Quaker.</span>—A gay young man, travelling
in a stage coach to London, forced
his deistical sentiments on the company,
by attempting to ridicule the Scriptures;
and, among other topics, made himself
merry with the story of David and Goliath,
strongly urging the impossibility of
a youth like David being able to throw a
stone with sufficient force to sink into
the giant’s forehead. On this he appealed
to the company, and particularly
to a grave Quaker gentleman, who sat
silent in one corner of the carriage. “Indeed,
friend,” replied he, “I do not think
it at all impossible, if the Philistine’s
head was as soft as thine.” This grave
rebuke reduced the young man to silence.</p>

On the next day it was agreed among

to draw him into a dispute, with the design
of making a jest of him and of his
doctrine. The wag accordingly went,
was introduced into the minister’s study,
and commenced the conversation by saying,
“I believe there is a small dispute
between you and me, sir, and I thought
I would call this morning and try to
settle it.” “Ha!” said the clergyman,
“what is it?” “Why,” replied the
wag, “you say that the wicked will go
into punishment, and I do not think that
they will.” “Oh, if that is all,” said the
minister, “there is no dispute between
you and me. If you turn to Matt. xxv.
46, you will find that the dispute is between
you and the Lord Jesus Christ,
and I advise you to go immediately and
settle it with him.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Countryman.</span>—It has often been a
matter of wonder, that the principles and
reasonings of infidels, though frequently
accompanied with great natural and acquired
abilities, are seldom known to
make any impression upon thoughtful
people. It is said of a deceased gentleman,
who was eminent in the literary
world, that in early life he drank deeply
of the free-thinking scheme. He and
one of his companions, of the same turn
of mind, often carried on their conversations
in the hearing of a religious but illiterate
countryman. This gentleman afterwards
became a true Christian, and felt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
concerned for the countryman, lest his
faith in Christianity should have been
shaken. One day, therefore, he asked
him, whether what had so frequently
been advanced in his hearing, had not
produced this effect upon him. “By no
means,” answered the countryman; “it
never made the least impression upon
me.” “No impression upon you!” said
the gentleman; “why, you must have
known that we had read and thought on
these things much more than you had
any opportunity of doing.” “Oh, yes,”
replied the man; “but I knew also your
manner of living; I knew that to maintain
such a course of conduct, you found
it necessary to renounce Christianity.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. S. Wesley.</span>—The Rev. Samuel
Wesley, rector of Epworth, and father
of the celebrated John Wesley, once went
into a coffee-house in London for some
refreshment. There were several gentlemen
in a box at the other end of the
room, one of whom, an officer of the
guards, swore dreadfully. The rector
saw that he could not speak to him
without much difficulty; he therefore
desired the waiter to give him a glass of
water. When it was brought, he said
aloud, “Carry it to your gentleman in
the red coat, and desire him to wash his
mouth after his oaths.” The officer rose
up in a fury; but the gentlemen in the
box laid hold of him, one of them crying
out, “Nay, colonel, you gave the first
offence; you see the gentleman is a
clergyman; you know it is an affront to
swear in his presence.” The officer was
thus restrained, and Mr. Wesley departed.</p>

<p>Some years after, being again in London,
and walking in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James’s Park, a
gentleman joined him, who, after some
conversation, inquired if he recollected
having seen him before. Mr. Wesley
replied in the negative. The gentleman
then recalled to his mind the scene in
the coffee-house; and added, “Since
that time, sir, I thank God, I have feared
an oath; and as I have a perfect recollection
of you, I rejoiced at seeing you,
and could not refrain from expressing
my gratitude to God and to you.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Fox.</span>—When Fox, the well
known author of the “Book of Martyrs,”
was once leaving the palace of Aylmer,
the Bishop of London, a company of
poor people begged him to relieve their
wants with great importunity. Fox,
having no money, returned to the bishop,
and asked the loan of five pounds, which
was readily granted; he immediately
distributed it among the poor, by whom
he was surrounded. Some months after,
Aylmer asked Fox for the money he had
borrowed. “I have laid it out for you,”
was the answer, “and paid it where you
owed it—to the poor people who lay at
your gate.” Far from being offended,
Aylmer thanked Fox for thus being his
steward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Intemperance.—A Temperate Man.</span>
A man of temperate habits was once
dining at the house of a free drinker.
No sooner was the cloth removed from
the dinner table, than wine and spirits
were produced, and he was asked to take
a glass of spirits and water. “No, thank
you,” said he, “I am not ill.” “Take
a glass of wine then,” said his host, “or
a glass of ale.” “No, thank you,” said
he, “I am not thirsty.” These answers
produced a loud burst of laughter.</p>

<p>Soon after this, the temperate man
took a piece of bread from the sideboard,
and handed it to his host, who refused
it, saying he was not hungry. At this,
the temperate man laughed in his turn.
“Surely,” said he, “I have as much
reason to laugh at you for not eating
when you are not hungry, as you have
to laugh at me for declining medicine
when not ill, and drink when I am not
thirsty.”</p>

Geography.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Geography</span> is that science which describes
the earth on which we live; its
lands and waters; its mountains and
valleys; its hills and plains; its towns,
cities, countries, nations, and inhabitants.</p>

<p>The above picture is a representation
of one half of the earth, or what is called
the <em>Western Hemisphere</em>. On this you
see the <em>continent</em> of America, the Atlantic
<em>Ocean</em>, the Pacific ocean, the Northern
ocean, and the Southern ocean. About
three fourths of the surface of the Western
hemisphere is covered with water.</p>

<p>The continent of America consists of
North America and South America.
These are united by a narrow strip of
land, called the <em>isthmus</em> of Darien. In
the narrowest part, this isthmus is but
about thirty-seven miles wide.</p>

<p>North America is separated from Asia
at the north-west, by Behring’s <em>Straits</em>,
which are about thirty-nine miles wide.
North America is separated from Greenland,
which is a great <em>island</em>, almost
always covered with snow and ice, near
the north <em>pole</em>.</p>

<p>The continent of North America is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
about 9000 miles long, from <em>Cape</em> Horn,
to the Northern ocean. It has a vast
<em>range of mountains</em>, extending, in a
bending line, nearly the whole length
of it. This range is the longest in the
world. In South America, some of the
mountains are about five miles high, and
are the loftiest in the world, except the
peaks of the Himmaleh mountains, in
Asia. It is supposed that there are two
hundred <em>volcanoes</em> in America.</p>

<p>The largest <em>river</em> in the world is the
Mississippi, which, including the Missouri,
properly one of its branches, is
about 4000 miles long. The river Amazon,
in South America, though not quite
as long, spreads its branches wider than
any other river in the world, and carries
more water to the sea than any other
river.</p>

<p>The largest fresh water lake in the
world, is that of Lake Superior, in North
America.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The above picture represents the <em>Eastern
Hemisphere</em>. It includes the Eastern
Continent, which is divided into Europe,
Asia, and Africa. Africa is the south-western
portion, Europe the north-western
portion, and Asia the north-eastern
portion. The eastern continent contains
about twice as much land as the western
continent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
Between Europe, Africa and Asia, is
the Mediterranean sea, which is about
2000 miles long, from east to west. The
Atlantic ocean lies west of Europe and
Africa; the Indian ocean lies south of
Asia, and south-east of Africa; the Pacific
ocean lies east of Asia.</p>

<p>Between the Indian ocean and Pacific
ocean, are many large islands. The
largest is New Holland, which is about
as extensive as all Europe. This island
belongs to the British nation, who have
settlements here, occupied by English,
Scotch, and Irish people.</p>

<p>There are many curious things upon
this island. The natives are a kind of
negro, who live in a manner almost as
rude and savage as wild bears. Among
the animals, are the kangaroo, which
goes forty feet at a leap, and the platypus,
with fur like a beaver and a bill
like a duck; swans which are black, and
a kind of bird with a tail shaped like a
harp.</p>

<p>Asia is the most populous part of the
globe, and has more inhabitants than
Europe, Africa, and America, all together.
China alone has about three
hundred and sixty millions of people.</p>

<p>In America there are only a few great
cities, such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia,
Baltimore, and New Orleans,
in the United States; Havana, in the
West Indies; Mexico, in the United
States of Mexico; Lima, Buenos Ayres,
Valparaiso, and Rio Janeiro, in South
America.</p>

<p>In Europe there are many great cities,
among which London and Paris are the
largest; in Asia, Constantinople and
Pekin are the largest; in Africa, Grand
Cairo and Alexandria are the largest.</p>

<p>Asia was the first part of the globe
inhabited by human beings; Africa was
next inhabited, Europe next, and America
last. America was not discovered by
the Europeans, till about three hundred
and fifty years ago.</p>

</div>

<h2 class="no-break">
The Bob-o-link.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the familiar name of the Rice
Bunting. He is about seven inches and
a half long, of a deep black color, with
the feathers edged with white and yellow.
In Massachusetts, it is first seen
in May, among the fields and meadows,
which at that period begin to ring with
its cheerful song. This is familiar to
every school-boy, and is composed of
sounds which resemble the words Bob-o-lee,
Bob-o-linke. Mr. Nuttall, who
has written several books about birds,
says that as the Bob-o-link rises and hovers
on the wing, near his mate, he seems
to say—“Bob-o-link, Bob-o-link, Tom
Denny, Tom Denny, come, pay me the
two and sixpence you’ve owed me more
than a year and a half ago! tshe, tshe,
tsh, tsh, tshe!” He then dives down
into the grass, as if to avoid a reply.</p>

<p>This bird builds its nest on the ground;
it is formed of loose withered grass,
and can scarcely be distinguished from
the earth around it. The eggs are five
or six, of a light olive color, spotted with
brown. The male keeps up a continued
song while his partner is sitting, as if to
cheer her in her confinement; but when
the young brood appear, this song is less
frequent, and he joins his mate in the
task of feeding and rearing them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
In August, the whole brood, old and
young, set off for the south, where they
spend the winter, gathering the wild rice
of Delaware as they proceed, and offering
great sport to the gunner. They
swarm in the rice fields of Carolina and
Georgia, and are much disliked by the
planters for their voracity. They are
excellent eating, being so fat when they
reach the West Indies, as to be called
Butter birds. Here they spend the winter,
but never fail to return in the spring
to their native meadows, where they feed
on insects, worms, crickets, beetles, and
also on grass seeds.</p>

<p>Boys are very fond of catching the
Bob-o-link, which they sell for cages;
but, although he is tolerably lively in
captivity, yet no one who has seen and
heard him at liberty, can take any pleasure
in his deadened music and dulled
plumage. In a state of nature all birds
moult, that is, change their plumage, and
after a time generally reappear in their
former gay attire; but we have been told
that the Bob-o-link, in captivity, after
moulting once, never resumes the dress
he wore in freedom; as if, absent from
his mate, for whom alone he sung and
plumed himself, it were of no consequence
what his appearance might be.
Let those of my little readers who have
an opportunity of observing, see if this
story be true.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
The White or Polar Bear.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> formidable animal is generally
found within the polar circle. It is a
land animal, yet it depends upon the sea
for its subsistence. It preys principally
upon seals, young walruses and whales,
and upon those foxes and wolves which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
sometimes seek their food among the
ice. Its size varies, being from eight to
twelve feet long, and weighing from 900
to 1600 pounds. His fur is thick and
very long, and, like the feathers of water
birds, cannot be wet by almost any exposure
to water. He swims at the rate of
three miles an hour. He cannot climb
trees like other bears, nor does he need
so to do, as his habitation is among the
icebergs. He is a very formidable and
powerful animal, and when attacked,
makes desperate resistance.</p>

<p>From the nature of their food, the flesh
of the polar bear is rank and fishy, though
not unwholesome. The fat resembles
tallow, and melts into a transparent oil,
which has no offensive smell. The skin
is very serviceable, as well as handsome,
for a variety of domestic purposes, and
it is an article of considerable value to
the people of the cold northern regions.
The Greenlanders pull it off whole, and
make a sack of it, into which they creep,
and find a warm and comfortable bed.
The natives of Hudson’s Bay make very
handsome and pliable garments of these
skins.</p>

<p>The Polar Bear may be considered as
the most interesting of all bears. Much
is said of its great strength, and power
of enduring hunger and cold; of the
peculiarity of its form and appearance;
of the perils and privations to which it
must often be exposed; of its great ferocity
and daring when attacked, and of its
strong attachment to its young. Nothing
but death can stop the attentions of the
female to her cubs. When they are
wounded, she will fondle them, turn
them over, lick them, offer them food,
and pay them even more tender attentions
than some human beings bestow
upon their offspring; and when she finds
all her efforts unavailing, she makes
most piteous moans.</p>

<p>The White Bear is found in the polar
regions of both continents.</p>

<span class="smcap">The Boy and his Mittens.</span>—I was
going around the corner of Park street
church, in February, 1835. It was the
morning of one of those days when the
thermometer was hovering about the
chill point of zero. I chanced to notice
a small boy, standing with his back to
the basement wall of the church; his
cheeks glistening in the keen wind, the
tears flowing down his face, and a kind
of blubbering sound issuing from his
mouth. His little red hands were bare,
but in one of them he held a pair of mittens.
He was the picture of distress and
imbecility. I went up to him, and asked
him why he was crying. “My fingers
are cold,” said he. “But why don’t
you put on your mittens?” said I. “Oh,
because my fingers are so cold!” said
he. “But can’t you put them on?”
said I. “Oh yes, I <em>can</em> put them on,”
said the boy, “but it hurts.”</p>

<p>“The child is father of the man,”
thought I. This boy, here, in a matter
of his fingers, is acting precisely as many
men act in regard to matters of the deepest
importance. Rather than bear the
slight pain of putting on his mittens, he
will run the risk of freezing his fingers.
And when I see a man spending his
time in idleness, and thus laying up a
prospect of future poverty and distress,
rather than work and be industrious, <em>I
think of the boy and his mittens</em>. When
I see a man indulging in a habit of tippling,
or any other bad practice, <em>because
it is hard to leave off, I think of the boy
and his mittens</em>.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><a id="v5P174b"></a>
<span class="smcap">Idleness.</span>—If the intellect requires to
be provided with perpetual objects, what
must it be with the affections? Depend
upon it, the most fatal idleness is that of
the heart; and the man who feels weary
of life may be sure that he does not love
his fellow-creatures as he ought.</p>

<h2>
The Unfaithful Servant.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A noble</span> Duke of Scotland, in one of
his walks, chanced one day to see a very
fine cow. Having ascertained to whom
the animal belonged, he went to the
owner, and offered him a handsome price
for her. For a time the latter hesitated,
but at length accepted it, and promised
to drive the cow the next morning.</p>

<p>Not finding it convenient to go himself,
the farmer sent his boy to drive the
cow. On approaching the house, the
animal appeared frightened, and refused
to proceed. At the time, the Duke happened
to be walking at a short distance,
and the boy, not knowing who he was,
craved his assistance, in his Scotch
brogue.</p>

<p>“Heh, mun, come here, an’ gie’s a
han’ wi’ this beast.”</p>

<p>The Duke, perceiving the boy’s mistake,
pursued his walk, without appearing
to understand it. In the mean time,
the cow became still more unmanageable,
upon which the lad, with a tone of apparent
distress, cried out, “Come here,
mun, and as sure’s anything, I’ll gie ye
the hauf o’ what I get.”</p>

<p>Pleased with the boy’s manner, and
especially with his generosity, the Duke
now stepped forward as requested, and
lent a helping hand.</p>

<p>“And now,” said the Duke, as they
drove the cow forward, “how much do
you think you will get for this job?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I dinna ken,” said the boy, “but
I’m sure o’ something, for the folk up
bye at the house are guid to a’ bodies.”</p>

<p>As they approached the house, the
Duke darted by the boy, and, entering by
a private way, called a servant, and putting
a sovereign into his hand, bid him
give it to the boy that drove the cow.</p>

<p>The Duke now returned to the avenue,
and was soon rejoined by the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, and how much did you get,
my lad?” inquired the Duke.</p>

<p>“A <em>shilling</em>,” said the boy, “and
there’s half o’t t’ ye.”</p>

<p>“A shilling!” rejoined the Duke,
“only a shilling! you got more.”</p>

<p>“No I dinna,” said the boy with great
earnestness, “as sure’s death, that’s a’ I
get, and d’ye no think it plenty?”</p>

<p>“I do not,” said the Duke; “there
must be some mistake, and as I am acquainted
with the Duke, if you’ll return
with me, I’ll get you some more money.”</p>

<p>The boy consented, and back they
went. The Duke rang the bell, and
ordered all the servants to be assembled.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the Duke to the boy,
“point out to me the person that gave
you the shilling.”</p>

<p>“It was the chap there, wi’ the white
apron,” said the boy, pointing to the butler.</p>

<p>“You villain,” said the Duke.</p>

<p>The butler fell upon his knees, and
confessed the wicked act.</p>

<p>“Give the boy the sovereign, and
immediately leave my house,” said the
Duke.</p>

<p>The butler implored.</p>

<p>“No,” said the Duke, “you are no
longer to be trusted. You have been
detected in an act of villany, which renders
you unfit to serve <em>me</em>. You have
lost your shilling, your situation, and
your character. Go, and henceforth
learn that ‘honesty is the best policy.’”</p>

<p>By this time, the boy discovered, to
his amazement, his assistant, in the person
of the Duke; and the Duke was so
delighted with the sterling worth and
honesty of the boy, that he ordered him
to be sent to school, and to be provided
for at his own expense.</p>

<h2>
The Barber of Paris.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the city of Paris, there is an ancient
street known by the name of Rue de la
Harpe. In one part of this street there
formerly stood two dwelling-houses, in
one of which a crime of a most horrible
nature was some years since perpetrated,
and the discovery of which was remarkably
sudden and providential.</p>

<p>In one of these houses a barber had
his shop; a part of the adjoining house
was occupied by a pastry-cook.</p>

<p>One day two gentlemen entered the
shop of the barber for the purpose of
being shaved. These gentlemen belonged
to a town some distance from
Paris. They were men of wealth, and
had come to the city for the purpose of
transacting business. It is not uncommon
for persons in France, who are
well able to ride, to travel on foot. In
this manner had these gentlemen come
to the city. Their only attendant was
a faithful dog.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to execute their
business, they called, as I said, at the
shop of the barber to get shaved. The
barber being employed in shaving another
person, the strangers, in the interim,
incautiously entered into conversation
with each other, during which they alluded
to a sum of money which they had
about them. The barber overheard them,
but appeared to take no notice of the
conversation.</p>

<p>At length one of the strangers was
called to the chair, and the shaving operation
was soon finished. This done,
he turned to his companion, and observed,
“We have but a short time, you know,
to transact all our business; and now,
while you are being shaved, I will step
down the street and attend to an errand
which has been entrusted to me.”</p>

<p>“Return soon,” said his friend.</p>

<p>“Before you are ready to move,”
replied he; and upon this he left the shop,
and hastened forward to perform the
errand.</p>

<p>After a short absence only, he was
again at the door of the barber’s shop;
on opening which, he was informed that
his friend was already gone.</p>

<p>“Gone!” said the other with some
surprise. But as the dog, which belonged
to his friend, was still sitting without the
door, he ceased to wonder; and, as his
friend would probably be back soon, he
seated himself, and chatted with the
barber, till he should return.</p>

<p>A half hour had passed, and he began
to be impatient. At length, he went out,
and walked up and down the street; but
nothing could he see or learn of his
friend. Again he returned to the shop,
and again interrogated the barber. “Did
my friend leave any message for me?”
“No,” said the barber, “all I know is,
that when he was shaved he went out.”</p>

<p>“It is strange,” said the man.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> singular,” said the barber. “I
wish I could help you, my friend. Pray
command my services, as you please.”</p>

<p>But the stranger knew not what measures
to adopt. At length, the singular
movements of the dog, still there, attracted
his notice. He appeared restless and
watchful; and, at intervals, uttered a
low and piteous howl. This startled
the stranger, and the suspicion of foul
play crossed his mind. He hinted his
suspicion, delicately indeed, but the barber
took fire and ordered him to quit the
shop.</p>

<p>The manner of the barber rather increased
than allayed his suspicion. And
then the dog—his conduct was inexplicable.
Nothing would induce him to
quit the place. The poor animal appeared
kind to the remaining stranger,
but nothing would induce him to stir
from the spot.</p>

<p>The distress of the stranger now
amounted to agony. At length he ventured
to make known his story to some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
passers-by. They stopped and listened.
Others came up and listened also. A
crowd was soon collected.</p>

<p>By some it was proposed to send for
the officers of the police. Others said,
“No, let us search the house.” This
latter course was at length agreed upon.
Accordingly, a competent number of men
entered, and as the people greatly increased
without, they barred the door,
and began to examine. No discovery,
however, was made, and the search was
relinquished.</p>

<p>All this time, however, the dog continued
at his post. At length, when the
search was through, and nothing found,
the barber requested the people to leave
his shop, which they did. Now, coming
to the door, he began to assure the people
of his innocence. At this moment
the dog descried him. In an instant he
sprang and caught him by the throat.
Persons flew to his assistance, and, at
the hazard of their lives, rescued him
from the grasp of the dog, who seemed
urged on with indescribable madness and
fury.</p>

<p>What could this mean? Was the
dog really mad, or had the barber secretly
made way with his master? One opinion
only prevailed. There had in some
way been foul play, and the dog was only
acting out the sagacity which the God
of nature had given him. It was agreed
that the dog should have his liberty and
be allowed to pursue the course he
pleased.</p>

<p>The crowd fell back, the doors were
opened, and the dog let loose. He
sprang to the threshold, and entering the
shop, smelled his way down a pair of
stairs into a dark cellar, which he filled
with his howlings.</p>

<p>The noise of the dog was heard without.
Several persons entered the shop—lights
were procured, and on searching
the cellar, a door was found which communicated
with the cellar of the adjoining
house. Information was immediately
given to the people above. They
forthwith surrounded the house. That
cellar was also searched, and there was
found the murdered remains of the unfortunate
stranger. On his trial, the
barber confessed his guilt.</p>

<h2>
The World within a Plant.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">The</span> fragrance of a carnation,” says
a fine writer, “led me to enjoy it frequently
and near.” While inhaling the
powerful sweet, I heard an extremely
soft, but agreeable murmuring sound.
It was easy to know that some animal,
within the covert, must be the musician,
and that the little noise must come from
some little body suited to produce it. I
am furnished with apparatus of a thousand
kinds for close observation. I instantly
distended the lower part of the
flower, and placing it in a full light,
could discover troops of little insects,
frisking and capering with wild jollity
among the narrow pedestals that supported
its leaves, and the little threads that
occupied its centre. I was not cruel
enough to pull out any one of them, but
adapting a microscope to take in, at one
view, the whole base of the flower, I
gave myself an opportunity of contemplating
what they were about, and this for
many days together, without giving
them the least disturbance.</p>

<p>Under the microscope, the base of the
flower extended itself to a large plain;
the slender stems of the leaves became
trunks of so many stately cedars; the
threads in the middle seemed columns
of massy structure, supporting at the top
their several ornaments; and the narrow
places between were enlarged into walks,
parterres and terraces.</p>

<p>On the polished bottom of these,
brighter than Parian marble, walked in
pairs, alone or in large companies, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
winged inhabitants; these, from little
dusky flies, for such only the naked eye
would have shown them, were raised to
glorious glittering animals, stained with
living purple and with a glossy gold,
that would have made all the labors of
the loom contemptible in the comparison.</p>

<p>I could, at leisure, as they walked together,
admire their elegant limbs, their
velvet shoulders, and their silken wings;
their backs vying with the empyrean in
its hue; and their eyes, each formed of
a thousand others, out-glittering the
little planes on a brilliant. I could observe
them here singling out their favorite
females, courting them with the
music of their buzzing wings, with little
songs formed for their little organs, leading
them from walk to walk among the
perfumed shades, and pointing out to
their taste the drop of liquid nectar, just
bursting from some vein within the living
trunk. Here were the perfumed groves,
the more than myrtle shades, of the
poet’s fancy realized; here the happy
lovers spent their days in joyful dalliance;
in the triumph of their little hearts,
skipped after one another from stem to
stem among the painted trees; or winged
their short flight to the shadow of some
broader leaf, to revel in the heights of
all felicity.</p>

<p>Nature, the God of nature, has proportioned
the period of existence of every
creature to the means of its support.
Duration, perhaps, is as much a comparative
quality as magnitude; and these
atoms of being as they appear to us, may
have organs that lengthen minutes, to
their perception, into years. In a flower,
destined to remain but a few days, length
of life, according to our ideas, could not
be given to its inhabitants; but it may
be, according to theirs. I saw, in the
course of observation of this new world,
several succeeding generations of the
creatures it was peopled with; they
passed under my eye, through the several
successive states of the egg and the
reptile form, in a few hours. After these,
they burst forth, at an instant, into full
growth and perfection in their wing form.
In this, they enjoyed their span of being
as much as we do years; feasted, sported,
revelled in delights; fed on the
living fragrance that poured itself out at
a thousand openings at once before them;
enjoyed their loves; laid the foundation
for their succeeding progeny, and, after
a life thus happily filled up, sunk in an
easy dissolution. With what joy in
their pleasures did I attend the first and
the succeeding broods through the full
period of their joyful lives! With what
enthusiastic transport did I address to
each of these yet happy creatures, Anacreon’s
gratulations to the cicada:</p>

<p>While the pure contemplative mind
thus almost envies what the rude observer
would treat unfeelingly, it naturally
shrinks into itself, on the thought
that there may be, in the immense chain

are reasoners who argue, on no better
foundation, that the earth which we inhabit
is eternal.</p>

The Kildeer Plover.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> bird is so called from its cry,
resembling the word <em>kildeer</em>, and is well
known in all parts of the United States.
It builds its nest in level pastures which
afford pools of water, or on sandy downs
near the sea. Its nest is a mere hollow,
lined with straw or weeds; the eggs are
four, cream-colored, and spotted with
black. The bird is about ten inches
long, is of an olive-gray color, and has
long legs, which enable it to wade in the
water, of which it is very fond.</p>

<p>While rearing its young, the kildeer
makes an incessant noise, and if any one
approaches its nest, it flies around and
over him, calling <em>kildeer</em>, <em>kildeer</em>, <em>te dit</em>,
<em>te dit</em>, <em>te dit</em>, seeming to evince the utmost
anxiety. If this clamor does not frighten
away the intruder, it will run along the
ground, with hanging wings, pretending
to be lame, in order to draw off attention
from the nest. It seems to be a sleepless
bird, for it may be heard very late at
night, in the spring and fall.</p>

<p>The kildeer feeds on grasshoppers and
insects which it finds in fields and in
pools of water, wading in search of them.
It is very erect, runs with great swiftness,
and flies very high in the air. Toward
autumn, large flocks descend to the seashore,
where they are more silent and
circumspect.</p>

<h3 class="allsmcap">
A STORY FOR PARENTS.<br>
</h3>
<p class="center allsmcap small">
FOR MERRY’S MUSEUM.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> and lady, the parents
of an only daughter about three years
old, residing in one of our southern cities,
proposed, a few months since, a visit to
the lady’s friends at the north. She was
particularly anxious once more to see an
aged mother, who, during her absence,
had experienced a long and distressing
sickness, and whom, considering the distance
which separated their residences,
she could not hope to see many times
more. One day, she told Augusta, her
little daughter, of the journey, and inquired
how she should like it. Of
course, the child was delighted with the
project, and from that time it occupied
many of her thoughts and much of her
conversation. She should see her friends,
of whom her mother had made frequent
mention, and especially her grandmother,
who, of all the rest, was of course an object
of the greatest interest. Augusta’s
inquiries, about her in particular, were
often repeated, and almost daily the
question was renewed when her father
would be ready to start.</p>

<p>After her usual round of inquiries
about the journey and her mother’s
friends, Augusta, one day, concluded by
saying, “My grandmother will be glad
to see me—don’t you think she will,
mother?” “Certainly,” replied the
mother. “Don’t you think she will be
very glad to see me?” “Yes,” said the
mother, “she will almost eat you up.”</p>

<p>The reply was inconsiderate, but who
has not heard it a hundred times?
Nothing more common—but it sunk deep
into the heart of the child, and from that
time, though she continued daily to talk
of the contemplated journey, it was with
diminished joy, and sometimes with positive
reluctance. The idea of being devoured,

and by one with whom she had
associated so many ideas of tenderness
and love, preyed, as it was afterwards
discovered, upon her imagination, and
nearly annihilated her hitherto happy
anticipations. She frequently spoke of
her grandmother’s devouring her, and on
one occasion gave her father a pretty
serious practical idea of the manner in
which she expected her aged relative
would proceed. She began by telling
him what her mother had said—that her
grandmother loved her so well that she
would eat her up. “When she sees me,
she will do <em>so</em>,” said Augusta—applying
her sharp little teeth to his cheek,
which brought the blood to the surface,
and at the same time sent a pang to the
extremities of his frame—“she will
do <em>so</em>!”</p>

<p>The time set for their departure at
length arrived, and Augusta and her
parents, in a few weeks, reached the
place of their destination. From motives
of convenience, the grandmother had,
some months before, left her own residence,
and was at lodgings in the village
of W——. Consequently, the parents
of Augusta sought quarters at a friend’s
in the immediate neighborhood.</p>

<p>After a few hours’ rest, a call upon the
grandmother was proposed, and Augusta
was to accompany her parents. But she
did not wish to go. “Why, my daughter,”
inquired the mother—“do you not wish
to see your dear grandmother?” Augusta
was silent. “You were delighted,” continued
the mother, “with the idea before
you left home—what has changed your
mind?” Augusta made no reply—but
she did not wish to go. Thinking that
her reluctance was the offspring of a childish
whim, or at most the effect of timidity
at meeting one who, notwithstanding her
relationship, was indeed a stranger, but
which would be removed in a single half
hour’s acquaintance, she insisted upon
her going.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
A walk of a few minutes brought them
to the residence of this object of love and
tenderness to the mother, but of distrust
and terror to the daughter. They were
ushered into her presence. The meeting
of the younger and of her more aged
mother was tender and mutually affecting.
They embraced each other after
the lapse of years, and each imparted
and each received a kiss of friendship
and affection. Tears flowed in copious
streams, if not along the cheeks of her
aged mother, down those of her daughter.</p>

<p>Augusta, young as she was, was an
intent and interested spectator of the
scene. She watched every look—marked
every action—weighed every word.
Her own time of being welcomed soon
came, when the caresses of the grandmother
were transferred from the daughter
to the grand-daughter. She shuddered
in the embrace—and her eyes,
generally large and brilliant, rolled more
widely and wildly; but she escaped the
anticipated mastication, and at length
breathed more at her ease!</p>

<p>Augusta was delighted, as she bounded
forth from the gate into the path that led
back to her lodgings, and was as much
inclined to expedite her return, as she had
been slow and reluctant in going.</p>

<p>Up to this time the intensity of her
feelings was unknown, and even the nature
of them was scarcely if at all
suspected. But the secret was gradually
developed, and at length the parents
were able to explain many a circumstance
and many a declaration in regard to
Augusta’s change of feelings towards her
grandmother, which, perhaps, with more
consideration, they might have explained
before, but which had been set down
rather to the whim of the child than the
unguarded expression of the mother.</p>

<p>On reaching her quarters, a young
lady, to whom the casual mention had
been made that Augusta expected her
grandmother would eat her up, said to
<span class="lock">her—</span></p>

<p>“Well, Miss Augusta, your grandmother,
it seems, didn’t eat you up.”</p>

<p>“No, she didn’t eat <em>me</em>,” said she,
“but she tried to eat <em>mother</em>.”</p>

<p>Some circumstance at the moment
intervening, the conversation was interrupted,
but on the following day, it was
renewed by Augusta herself, who, approaching
her mother, said:</p>

<p>“Mother, what did grandma’ do to you
yesterday?”</p>

<p>“She kissed me, my dear.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t kiss you mother—she <em>bit</em>
you.”</p>

<p>“No, my daughter, you mistake, she
did not bite me, but she kissed me affectionately.”</p>

<p>“She <em>did</em> bite you, mother—I’m sure,
I saw her, and she made you cry.”</p>

<p>“My daughter—why!”</p>

<p>“You said, mother, one day when we
were at home, that grandmother would
eat <em>me</em> up, but she tried to eat <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>The grandmother, as already intimated,
had kissed her daughter fondly—with
a mother’s ardor. Augusta saw her
lips impressed on the mother’s cheek,
and the tears starting fast, and rolling
down; and she mistook the kiss for a
bite, and thought those tears of joy were
tears of pain. The whole mystery now
vanished. “She will love you so much
as to eat you up,” misconstrued, had
been for weeks and months a sort of
death-note sounding in the child’s imagination.
This story, however improbable
it may seem, is literally true, and
may show how careful of early impressions,
a parent should be.</p>

About the Chicadees,<br>
</h2>
<p class="center allsmcap smaller">
FOR MERRY’S MUSEUM.<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A good</span> many years ago, a man named
Alexander Wilson, a Scotchman by birth,
wrote a large book, called “American
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
Ornithology,” in which he described
almost all the birds belonging to this
country, and gave an account of their
nests and eggs, their food and habits, and
migrations, or removing from one part
of the country to another, &amp;c. He also
made pictures of all the birds described
in his book, which were beautifully
colored with the natural colors of the
birds themselves. Since then, another
celebrated naturalist, (as those men are
called, who study the works of nature,)
Mr. John J. Audubon, has made a
still larger book, with pictures, of the size
of life, of all the birds described by Mr.
Wilson and many others, and colored
also in the same beautiful manner, and
sometimes having several pictures of the
same bird, in different attitudes, and
showing its different habits, such as procuring
its food, building or sitting on its
nest, defending its young, &amp;c. One
copy of these books, (which consists of
five very large volumes, as large as a
small table, besides the volumes which
contain the descriptions and accounts of
the habits or biography of the birds,) costs
the very great sum of one thousand
dollars. It is very beautiful indeed, and
I hope all Robert Merry’s black and blue-eyed
friends will one day have an opportunity
to look at either this or Mr.
Wilson’s book, and see such beautiful
pictures as they contain.</p>

<p>As almost all good boys and girls are
fond of seeing birds, and hearing about
them, I think they will like to read
something more about them in Merry’s
Museum; and this is the reason why I
propose to write about some of them. I
hope, too, that none of those children
who read the Museum, will be guilty of
wantonly killing the little birds, or robbing
their nests of the eggs and young,
as some cruel boys do, but will learn to
love them and treat them kindly. I will
here copy a short story from Mr. Audubon’s
book, that I have been telling about.
</p>

<p>“On the 4th of January, we stopped
at Bonnet Carré, where I entered a house
to ask some questions about birds. I
was received by a venerable French
gentleman, whom I found in charge of
about a dozen children of both sexes, and
who was delighted to hear that I was a
student of nature. He was well acquainted
with my old friend Charles
Carré, and must, I thought, be a good
man, for he said he never suffered any
of his pupils to rob a bird of her eggs or
young, although, said he with a smile,
‘they are welcome to peep at them and
love them.’ The boys at once surrounded
me, and from them I received satisfactory
answers to most of my inquiries
respecting birds.”</p>

<p>This shows what feelings good children
should have towards birds.</p>

<p>I will now say something about the
Chicadee, or Black-capped Titmouse, as
the naturalists name him. He is a
beautiful bird, although his colors are
very plain and simple. His head is
covered with a black spot, that looks like
a cap; from which he takes the designation
of <em>Black-capped</em>. Why he is called
<em>Titmouse</em>, I cannot tell. The sides of
his head and neck are of a very pure
white, but he has another black spot on
his throat, which ends in a point on each
side of his neck. The contrast of the
deep black spots on his head and neck
with the pure white around them, gives
him a beautiful appearance. His back
and wings are brownish ash-color, or
bluish-brown, the wings rather darker,
and underneath he is a brownish white.
I presume almost all my little readers, in
the country especially, know him and
call him the Chicadee; for he is so called
from his note or song, which sounds very
much like Chicadee-dee-dee, Chicadee-dee-dee-dee,
and which you may hear
almost continually while he is hopping
about from tree to tree, and from limb to
limb, and exhibiting himself in almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
every imaginable position, gathering his
food.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson has a beautiful picture of
one hanging on the under side of a twig
and bending his black-capped head over
it to pick something from it, as you may
frequently see them do. Mr. Wilson
says in his book, “They also frequently
visit the orchards, particularly to fall,
the sides of the barn and barn-yard in the
same pursuit,—trees in such situations
being generally much infested with insects.
We, therefore, with pleasure,
rank this little bird among the farmer’s
friends, and hope our rural citizens will
always recognise him as such.” In the
same account he tells us how they make
their nests, &amp;c., as follows: “About the
middle of April they begin to build,
choosing the deserted hole of a squirrel,
or woodpecker, and sometimes, with incredible
labor, digging out one for themselves.
The female lays six white eggs,
marked with minute specks of red; the
first brood appear about the beginning of
June, and the second towards the end of
July; the whole of the family continue
to associate together during winter.</p>

<p>“They always go in little flocks, or
companies, probably, in general, of more
than one brood, and frequently are accompanied
with the white-breasted nuthatch,
or tomtit, as he is sometimes called in the
country, and also with the small woodpecker,
and sometimes, in spring and
fall, with the golden-crested wren,—a
beautiful and very small bird, with a
bright flame-colored spot on the crown of
his head,—and sometimes by the brown
creeper. Their food consists, in a great
part, of insects, though at some times in
the year, partly of seeds and of various
kinds of oily substances. They frequently
in the winter come around our houses
and woodsheds, to pick among whatever
offal is thrown out from the kitchen, and
often become very familiar. I sometimes
hang up bones and little bits of
meat by my woodshed, to which many of
them continue to resort and pick at them,
day after day. Sometimes they venture
into my wash-room; and one day this
winter, they were so bold that I clapped
my hand on one as he was feeding, and
caught him and took him into my kitchen,
where, after a few minutes, he began to
feed upon a bone that I hung up there.
He also sung his chicadee-dee-dee several
times while I kept him in the house.</p>

<p>“He has another note or song, which,
although not so merry and cheerful as
his common one of chicadee, is much
softer and sweeter, but is not so often
heard. On fine pleasant days of summer,
and especially on a delightful spring
morning, you may hear him, perched on
the top of a tree, utter at short intervals
a note of two syllables, sounding like the
word Phe-be,—the sound rising on the
first syllable, and falling on the last, and
sounding delightfully sweet.”</p>

<p class="p0">I am very much pleased with your Museum,
and I hope your stories may do me good. I am
going to Boston soon, and I hope I shall have
the pleasure of seeing you. I like the story of
the Siberian Sable-Hunter, and Thomas Trotter,
very much. I go to school all the time now,
and my time is so taken up with my studies
that I hope you will pardon me when I say that
I have not yet read quite the whole of Philip
Brusque. I feel sorry for this, but I am not yet
ten years old. I hope you will allow me to say,
and take it kindly, that I am often much disappointed
in not getting my number in season.
Many little girls get theirs sooner than I get
mine; and I wish you would say to those who
have the care of sending the Magazine to the
various subscribers, that I should like to have
mine sent sooner, and directed to <em>me</em> instead of
my father. I have tried to get subscribers for
you, but have not succeeded; but I will try
again during this volume,—for I think you offer
a handsome reward. I have been much pleased
with your allegories, and particularly with the
Garden of Peace, and I hope they will make a
good impression on my mind, and I have no
doubt it was your design they should. I am
sorry we do not have painted pictures in the
Museum now, for it made the Natural History
more interesting. I must tell you, when they
bound my numbers, they kept all my painted
pictures, and did not put them into the volume
which they bound. This grieves me much, and
I thought I would tell it to you. I have a little
sister, almost three years younger than myself,
and she likes to read your <cite>Little Leaves</cite> very
much, and thinks you are very kind to remember
such little ones. Please excuse all mistakes.</p>

</div>

<p class="hanging"><i>About spiders.—How they make their webs, set
their nets, and other things.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are a great many people who
imagine that such little things as bees,
bugs, butterflies, spiders and other insects,
are unworthy of their notice; but
this is a great mistake.</p>

<p>All these creatures have eyes, legs,
feet, and other organs. They are all
curiously contrived, like little machines,
to creep, crawl or fly. They have all
wonderful faculties; by which they are
able to get a living, and to make themselves
happy. They are, therefore, very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
interesting to all persons who will inquire
into their structure and their
habits.</p>

<p>These creatures are so common that
we are apt to overlook them as unworthy
of our notice; but Inquisitive Jack, the
hero of our story, did not fall into this
error. He had an inquiring mind, and
nothing was beneath his observation.</p>

<p>He had already discovered that there
were many curious and wonderful things,
even in insects, flowers, and other common
objects; and in the study of these,
he found never-ceasing amusement.</p>

<p>These things were like a pleasing
book, full of pretty stories and curious
pictures, and every day he found some
new and interesting page.</p>

<p>One morning, very soon after the sun
had risen, he was walking along among
some bushes; it was early summer, and
a heavy dew had fallen. As he was
going along, the thread of a spider, strung
from one bush to another, came across
his nose, and he broke it as he passed
along.</p>

<p>Pretty soon, he met with other instances,
in which the spiders’ threads
were extended from one shrub to another.
Now, Jack was always asking himself
how such and such a thing is done; and
he therefore began to inquire how these
spiders could stretch a line across from
one tree to another; for he observed that
these threads were sometimes ten, or
even fifteen feet from the ground, and
that they extended often to as great a distance
from the branch of one tree to that
of another.</p>

<p>Jack’s habit of investigation had made
him very ingenious in explaining things;
but here was something quite beyond his
reach. He could in no way explain
what he saw.</p>

<p>“Strange!” said Jack to himself,
“that these little insignificant spiders
should know more than I do. I like to
find out things myself, but I can’t explain
this; so I must go and ask aunt Piper
about it.”</p>

<p>As Jack turned on his heel to fulfil
his resolution, he noticed another spider’s
web, covered with dew. His attention
now being excited to the subject, he
turned round, and saw as many as fifty
others, set like nets among the bushes
and the tall grass.</p>

<p>Jack had seen these things before, but
his attention had not been excited, and
therefore he had not investigated them.
He now set about the inquiry, with all
the ardor of youthful curiosity.</p>

<p>He spent some time in observing the
different kinds of webs, and then proceeded
to his aunt to ask her about them.
She accordingly sat down, took her
knitting-work, and while she worked
briskly at her needles, she gave Jack
the information he desired. The best
way to tell the story, is to put it in the
form of a dialogue.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Oh! aunt Betsey, I’ve found
something so curious! Do you know
I’ve been looking at the spiders, and I
want to have you tell me about them.
Pray, where do they get their threads?
and how do they weave their nets so
curiously? and how do they fasten their
thread to the leaves? and how do they
stretch their threads from one tree to
another? and what do they do it all for—for
fun, or for business?</p>

<p><i>Aunt P.</i> One question at a time, if
you please, Jack.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Why, I want you to tell me all
about the spiders.</p>

<p><i>Aunt P.</i> But where shall I begin?</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Oh! I don’t care where you
begin—I want to have you tell me everything.</p>

<p><i>Aunt P.</i> Well, Jack, I’ll tell you
what I know, and I shall answer your
last question first. The spiders, I suppose,
make their nets both for fun and
business, for pleasure and profit. These
creatures are made to live chiefly upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
flies, but they are themselves destitute
of wings. They are, therefore, provided
with the means of making nets, by which
they can catch as many flies as they want.</p>

<p>Thus you see that God, who made the
spiders, has provided them with a good
trade, by which they can get a living.
So it is, dear Jack, that Providence provides
for everything—the wants of even
the insects are supplied; nothing is overlooked,
and we shall see, on investigation,
what wonderful ingenuity and contrivance
the Creator has resorted to, in
order to take care even of such insignificant
creatures as spiders.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> I thank you, aunt Betsey, for
that idea—it makes the spider much
more interesting, when we consider it as
the work of God.</p>

<p><i>Aunt P.</i> Yes, that is true, my boy.
Now, as the spiders spread their nets in
order to get a living, or for business, as
you express it, they do it also for pleasure—for
business and pleasure usually go
together.</p>

<p>It may be very agreeable to children
to scamper about, just for the sake of a
frolic, but, generally speaking, the path
of pleasure is the path of utility—in other
words, there is more real satisfaction in
doing something that is useful, than in
mere idle sport. It is so with human
beings, and, no doubt, it is so with
spiders.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Well, aunt Betsey, you have
answered one of my questions; but
pray tell me where the spiders get their
threads. They must have an immense
manufactory of it somewhere. Are any
of them rope-makers?</p>

<p><i>Aunt P.</i> Yes, Jack, every one of
them. Each one spins his own thread,
and this is the most wonderful part of
the whole story. You observe that the
lower part of a spider’s body consists of a
round ball.</p>

<p>In this, nature provides the insect with
a gummy substance, which is spun into
thread. It somewhat resembles melted
glass, for a coarse thread of it is brittle,
when it becomes dry; while a fine thread
is as flexible as the fibres of cotton or
silk.</p>

<p>The manner in which this gum or
paste, is twisted into threads, has occupied
the attention of many philosophers. By
looking at the process through magnifying
glasses, it has been discovered that
even the finest thread in the web of the
spider consists of many hundred strands.</p>

<p>These are drawn out from the body of
the insect, being then in a soft state,
like paste, but they immediately unite,
and form one compact cord. In some
instances, it is said that a single thread
consists of four thousand strands.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Whew! that sounds like a
whapper.</p>

<p><i>Aunt P.</i> Still, it is no doubt true.
There are many things invisible to the
naked eye, which are revealed to us by
the aid of magnifying glasses.</p>

<p>With the naked eye, we cannot see
more than a thousand stars in the sky;
with a telescope, we can see millions of
stars. To the naked eye, a glass of pure
water is perfectly transparent; yet a
microscope will show that it is full of
little animals.</p>

<p>With the naked eye, we can see
nothing but fibres in the stalk of a flower,
but by the aid of a microscope, we can
see there myriads of creeping things. So,
by the aid of a microscope, we can easily
discover the thousand strands of which
the spider’s thread is composed.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Well, aunt Betsey, I am not
going to dispute you, for I know that
you have always a good reason for what
you say. But, pray tell me, how do the
spiders tie their lines to the leaves and
grass?</p>

<p><i>Aunt P.</i> They stick them on with a
kind of glue, with which nature has provided
them.</p>

<p><i>Jack.</i> Well, how do they stretch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
their lines across from one tree to
another?</p>

<p><i>Aunt P.</i> When a spider wishes to
build a bridge from one shrub to another,
he climbs up to a certain height, and
draws out a long, loose line, taking care
to have it in such a situation that the
wind will carry it across to some other tree.</p>

<p>The end of the floating line is provided
with a gummy substance, and fastens itself
at once to whatever it touches.
When the spider finds that his line has
caught, he pulls it, to see if it is fast. If
it is loose, he draws it up till it is straight,
and then fastens it with gum.</p>

<p>Having secured the line, the spider
makes a bridge of it, and crosses over in
perfect safety. He now goes backwards
and forward, each time adding a thread,
for the purpose of giving it strength.</p>

<p>This line is like the rope to a fisherman’s
net, and the spider immediately
begins to weave his net upon it. He
proceeds to set several strings round
somewhat like the spokes of a wheel,
and these he binds together by a series
of circular threads.</p>

<p>When the whole is done, he weaves a
hole in some sly corner, into which he
retreats; but the moment that a fly gets
entangled in his net, he darts forth,
binds him round and round like a
prisoner, and carries him off to his
den.</p>

<p>Such was the main part of the dialogue
that passed between Jack and his
aunt. The boy expressed great satisfaction
for what she had told him, and then
went away to take another walk in the
fields.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">See</span> this boy with his hoop! How
the hoop flies, and how the little fellow
enjoys the fun! But take care, George!
take care—there is a ditch before you!</p>

<p>But, alas, George is like other boys,
so eager in his sport that he thinks of
nothing else. On goes the hoop, and on
goes George after it.</p>

<p>By-and-by, he comes to the ditch.
The hoop bounds across, and poor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
George tumbles in! What a sight he
is when he comes out—all over mud!
Next time, George, look before you leap—or,
in other words, be not so absorbed in
your sport, as to forget everything else.
Look a little before you, and see that
you run into no danger.</p>

<p>This looking before, is what we call
<em>prudence</em>. This heedless running on,
without seeing where one is going, we
call imprudence. A prudent person will
seldom get into trouble; an imprudent
person is very likely to get into a great
deal.</p>

<p>George was an imprudent boy, and
tumbled into the ditch. Let my young
friends take warning by his mishap; let
them cultivate prudence; in other words,
let them look ere they leap.</p>

Hay-Making.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is very pleasant to see the men at
work making the hay and getting it into
the barn. Do you not love to hear the
mower whetting his scythe? Do you
not love to see him swing his blade
through the grass, and see it fall before
him?</p>

<p>And how sweet is the fragrance of the
new-mown hay! When it is dry, do you
not love to see the men rake it into
heaps; then toss it on to the cart and
carry it away?</p>

<p>Hay-making is, indeed, a pleasant
business, and it is very useful also.
What would the poor cows and horses do
in winter if they had no hay?</p>

<p>In winter, the grass is dead, the leaves
have fallen from trees and shrubs, and
the earth is covered with snow. If there
were no hay in the barn, the horses, the
cows, and the sheep would all perish.</p>

<p>We should then have no horse to
draw us along in the sleigh; no cow to
give us milk; no sheep to supply us
with wool for clothing. Hay-making
is therefore very important business.</p>

<p>What do you think the people do in
very cold countries, where no grass
grows? They are obliged to use reindeer,
who feed on moss, and do not need
hay. These creatures give milk, like
cows; they draw sledges, like horses;
and their flesh is as good as the beef of
the ox.</p>

The Moth.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> moth looks like a butterfly, but it
is not so beautiful. The moth usually
flies by night, and the butterfly by day.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of moth; some
are large and some are small. You often
see moths flying into the lamp or candle,
of a summer evening.</p>

<p>Persons who are so fond of pleasure
as to injure themselves in the pursuit
of it, are compared to the silly moth,
which is dazzled with the light, flies into
it, and perishes.</p>

<p>Pleasure is a good thing, and I love
to see children pursue it—but some
kinds of pleasure are dangerous, and are
as fatal to young persons as the blaze of
the lamp or candle to the heedless fly or
moth.

The Balloon.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> is a picture of a balloon! It is
a great silk bag, with a net around it.
Fastened at the bottom of the net, is a
little car, in which a man sits.</p>

<p>The balloon rises into the air, and the
man in the car goes up with it. He
sails along like a cloud; at first the
balloon looks large, but it seems to grow
less and less, and by-and-by it looks no
larger than a fly. Then it disappears
and is seen no more.</p>

<p>Now, what do you think it is that
makes the balloon rise up into the air?
It is a kind of gas, which is very light.
The balloon is filled with this gas. You
know that smoke is so light as to rise up
in the air; but this gas is still lighter
than smoke.</p>

<p>Perhaps you desire to know how the
man gets his balloon down, when he has
risen in it up to the clouds. I will tell
you; he lets out a little of the gas, and
down he comes. He must be careful
to let out only a little at a time, so as to
come down gradually; if he lets out too
much, he will come down with a terrible
thump.

The Harrow.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a picture of a man with a harrow.
A harrow consists of several iron
spikes fixed in a frame. When this is
dragged over the ground, the spikes
break the earth in pieces, and thus fit it
to receive the seed.</p>

<p>If the seed be sown, then the harrow
is used to cover it up in the earth.
Perhaps my little readers do not care to
hear about the harrow, but how can they
have bread and butter without it?</p>

<p>We cannot have bread without wheat
to make it of; and we cannot have
wheat, unless the ground be duly ploughed
and harrowed. So my young readers
will see that the harrow is a good friend
of theirs, however little they care about
it.</p>

<h2>
Handsome is that handsome does.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><i>John.</i> Mama, I want something to look
at; what can I have?</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Why, my dear, cannot you
find something in the room to look at—some
pretty story-book, or amusing
puzzle?</p>

<p><abbr title="John"><i>J.</i></abbr> No, mama, I don’t want to read, or
be puzzled either; and I have looked
at the shells and fossils on the mantelpiece,
and the gold fishes in the globe,
and counted the window-panes and the
flowers on the carpet twenty times, and
I’ve been looking into the looking-glass
for the last half hour.</p>

<p><abbr title="Mother"><i>M.</i></abbr> Into the looking-glass, John! for
what purpose?</p>

<p><abbr title="John"><i>J.</i></abbr> That I might know how handsome
I am, mama.</p>

<p><abbr title="Mother"><i>M.</i></abbr> Why, do you really think that
you are handsome?</p>

<p><abbr title="John"><i>J.</i></abbr> Yes, mama; do not you?</p>

<p><abbr title="Mother"><i>M.</i></abbr> Only sometimes.</p>

<p><abbr title="John"><i>J.</i></abbr> Why—only sometimes, mama?</p>

<p><abbr title="Mother"><i>M.</i></abbr> Because, John, you are only handsome
when you are good; when you are
naughty, you are a very ugly little
fellow!</p>

<p><abbr title="John"><i>J.</i></abbr> Why, mama, my hair is always
curled, and my hands always white, and
I am sure that my clothes are always
very pretty.</p>

<p><abbr title="Mother"><i>M.</i></abbr> Yes, my dear, that may be; but
does any one love you more on this
account?</p>

<p><abbr title="John"><i>J.</i></abbr> I should think they do, mama.</p>

<p><abbr title="Mother"><i>M.</i></abbr> Then let me tell you, my dear,
that if a child be ever so pretty, and
dressed ever so fine, he cannot be loved
unless he is good. No person is pleasing
to look at, who is naughty. A person
who is naughty has a bad heart, and a
bad heart usually spoils the face.</p>

A Midsummer Morning.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Who</span> can tell the pleasures of a midsummer
morning! In order fully to
enjoy these, you must be up before the
sun: you must hear the robin, when it
timidly begins its song; and the sparrows,
when, with a gentle <cite>peep, peep</cite>, they say
good morning to one another,—and hop
from bush to bush to see if all is well;
and the boblink, when he clucks in the
grass, just before he enters upon his
song of “Tom Denny, Tom Denny;”
and you must see the first red light which
the sun throws upon the clouds and hill
tops; you must hear all the joyous
sounds that rise upward to heaven, as
if in thanksgiving, from the birds, the
insects, the cattle upon a thousand hills,
and the voices of glad human beings, far
and near; and you must have a heart to
appreciate all this, as a sweet anthem of
praise to God.</p>

<p>And you must have an eye that takes
in the beauty of flowers and dew-drops
around you, as well as of far-off landscapes,
embracing hills and vales, cloud,
sky and sea; your soul must be a pure
canvass for the Almighty’s pencil; your
ear a justly tuned instrument, for the
touch of a Divine musician. Who can
go forth of a midsummer morning, and
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_2">2</span>
not deeply feel the loveliness of nature,
and the benignity of that Being, who in
goodness has made it all?</p>

<p>It is well to hold communion with nature
in her gentler moods; and I always
esteem those persons happy who are
brought up in the country, among green
fields and shady woods, especially if
they have friends around them, who can
lift their thoughts, step by step, from nature
up to nature’s God. This world,
without a God, without a Creator, a Governor,
a Preserver—would be indeed a
mystery; but when we can connect all
the wonders we behold with a great and
good Being, who is at once our Father
in heaven, and the Architect of the earth
and the skies—these things acquire a
new and touching interest.</p>

<p>Look at the children in the picture.
The dew hangs on the stems of flowers
and the leaves of shrubs, like myriads
of trembling diamonds; the sun-light is
gushing through the trees—a glorious
flood of silver; the birds are pouring out
their songs of merriment and affection.
All around is beautiful. Happy children—lovely
midsummer morning!</p>

<h2>
Listening.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Much</span> has been said of the art of
speaking, and comparatively little on the
art of listening. Not to listen is an
offence against the laws of politeness.
Conversation is a species of commerce,
where every one has a right to bring and
to dispose of his commodities, and to
supply others with what he supposes they
stand in need of: therefore it ought to be
an exchange—a barter.</p>

<p>If to listen is a duty towards others,
it is also of the greatest utility and importance
to ourselves. Complaisance in
listening marks a wish to learn; he who
does not like to listen, does not wish to
learn the truth. <em>He who speaks, sows;
he who listens, reaps.</em>
</p>

<p>Nothing is more acceptable and pleasing
than the art of listening. We often
see men of superior abilities prefer the
society of those who are inferior, because
they listen with respect. This does not
originate in pride or vanity, but the mind
is raised and inflamed by awakening
attention and curiosity.</p>

<p>No one, on the contrary, is so displeasing
and offensive, as he who refuses his
attention, or who listens with a total
want of respect and politeness. Some
persons, as soon as you open your mouth,
pretend to know what you would say,
and appear impatient till you have done.
Some take the words out of your mouth
and contradict you sharply. Others
will begin to talk to another person, call
the servants, scold the children, or perhaps
turn their backs and leave you.</p>

<p>An eastern sage was once relating his
misfortunes to a statue. “Fool,” said a
traveller, “do you suppose that cold
marble hears you?” The sage replied,
“I know the marble hears me not; but,
at least, it does not interrupt me.”</p>

<p>There is a proper way of listening;
not that of the stupid and ignorant, who,
at every trifling word, open their eyes
and cry out, a miracle; nor that of those
who smile and applaud as soon as you
begin to speak. These resemble some
persons who would applaud at a theatre
as soon as the candles are lighted. We
must esteem those who listen to us, in
order to aspire to their praises, and to
acquire in their company the fire of eloquence,
and the desire to please.</p>

<p>Listening properly is appearing to observe,
to approve, and to be pleased; a
sensible remark, a delicate compliment,
a few words apparently suggested by
those of others, a single word introduced
with propriety, and even an intelligent
and animated look, a smile of approbation;
in short, that air of attention, of
interest, of esteem, when a person is talking
to us, is the greatest compliment we
can pay.</p>

Eugene Aram.<br>
</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> life of this man is fraught with
deep interest, and affords a striking
moral. Though born in humble circumstances,
and therefore only provided
with the means of a narrow education,
by the force of talent and industry he
improved his mind and made himself
master of a wide field of knowledge.</p>

<p>His station was now respectable in the
eyes of the world, and he had all the
requisite means to ensure happiness.
One thing, only, did he lack; yet, that
thing which is necessary to the preservation
of every earthly good—virtue.
In an evil hour he was tempted to the
commission of a horrid crime. Though
this was shielded by darkness; though
years rolled away without suspicion or
detection; though a fair outside was
carefully preserved; though he left the
scene of his depravity, and doubtless believed
he had forever buried his guilt
in oblivion—still the All-seeing Eye was
upon him, and He who rules over events,
as if to show how vain is human ingenuity
in attempting to shelter the murderer,
at last brought him to justice. On his
trial he displayed wonderful powers of
reasoning, but even these, now, only
served to heighten his guilt in the eyes
of mankind. How short-sighted is the
man who attempts to attain happiness by
unlawful means; which, even if successful,
must make every cup of life bitter
as gall; and, if unsuccessful, must
bring judgment, and agony, and shame.</p>

<p>During the confinement of this remarkable
person on the charge of murder,
he wrote an account of his own life,
from which we learn that one of his ancestors
had been high sheriff of Yorkshire,
in the reign of king Edward the
third; but the family, having been gradually
reduced, his father occupied a
humble station in life. The son, however,
was sent to a school near Ripon,
where he perfected himself in writing
and arithmetic, and then went to London
to officiate as clerk to a merchant.</p>

<p>After a residence of two years in
town, he was seized with the small-pox,
which left him in so weak a condition,
that he went back to Yorkshire for the recovery
of his health. On his recovery,
he found it necessary to do something for
immediate subsistence; and, accordingly
engaged himself as usher to a boarding-school;
but, not having been taught the
learned languages in his youth, he was
obliged to supply by industry what he
had failed to obtain from neglect.
Thus, while teaching writing and
arithmetic, by employing all his leisure
hours in the most intense study, he at
length became an excellent Greek and
Latin scholar. In the year 1734, he
engaged to officiate as steward of an
estate belonging to Mr. Norton, of
Knaresborough; and while in this station
he acquired a competent knowledge
of the Hebrew. At this period he married,
but was far from being happy in
his matrimonial connection.</p>

<p>We shall now relate the circumstances
which led to the commission of the crime
which cost Aram his life. Daniel
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_4">4</span>
Clarke, a shoemaker at Knaresborough,
after being married a few days, circulated
a report that his wife was entitled
to a considerable fortune, which he
should soon receive. Hereupon, Aram
and Richard Houseman, conceiving
hopes of making advantage of this circumstance,
persuaded Clarke to make
an ostentatious show of his own riches,
to induce his wife’s relations to give him
that fortune of which he had boasted.</p>

<p>Clarke was easily induced to comply
with a hint so agreeable to his own desires;
on which he borrowed and bought
on credit, a large quantity of silver plate,
with jewels, watches, rings, &amp;c. He
told the persons of whom he purchased,
that a merchant in London had sent
him an order to buy such plate for exportation;
and no doubt was entertained
of his credit till his sudden disappearance
in February, 1745, when it was
imagined that he had gone abroad or to
London, to dispose of his ill-acquired
property.</p>

<p>When Clarke was possessed of these
goods, Aram and Houseman determined
to murder him, in order to share the
booty; and on the night of the 8th of
February, 1745, they persuaded Clarke
to walk with them in the fields, in order
to consult with them on the proper
method to dispose of the effects.</p>

<p>On this plan they walked into a field,
at a small distance from the town, by
the name of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Robert’s Cave. When
they came into this field, Aram and
Clarke went over a hedge towards the
cave, and when they had got within six or
seven yards of it, Houseman (by the light
of the moon) saw Aram strike Clarke
several times, and at length beheld him
fall, but never saw him afterwards.
This was the state of the affair, if
Houseman’s testimony on the trial is to
be credited.</p>

<p>The murderers, going home, shared
Clarke’s ill-gotten treasure, the half of
which Houseman concealed in his garden
for a twelvemonth, and then took it
to Scotland, where he sold it. In the
mean time Aram carried his share to
London, where he sold it to a Jew, and
then engaged himself as an usher at an
academy in Piccadilly; where, in the intervals
of his duty in attending to scholars,
he made himself master of the
French language, and acquired some
knowledge of Arabic and other eastern
tongues.</p>

<p>After this he was usher at other
schools in different parts of the kingdom;
but as he did not correspond with
his friends in Yorkshire, it was presumed
that he was dead. The sudden
disappearance of Clarke had long been
forgotten; but, in the year 1758, as a
man was digging for limestone near <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Robert’s Cave, he found the bones of a
human body, and a conjecture hereupon
arose that they were the remains of
Clarke, who, it was now presumed,
might have been murdered.</p>

<p>Houseman, having been seen in company
with Clarke a short time before
his disappearance, was apprehended on
suspicion; and, on his examination, giving
but too evident signs of his guilt, he was
committed to York castle. The bones
of the deceased being shown to him, he
denied that they were those of Clarke,
but directed to the precise spot where he
said they were deposited, and where
they were accordingly found. The
skull, being fractured, was preserved, to
be produced in evidence on the trial.</p>

<p>Soon after Houseman was committed
to the castle of York, it was discovered
that Aram lived at Lynn, in Norfolk;
on which, a warrant was granted for
taking him into custody; and, being apprehended
while instructing some young
gentlemen at a school, he was conveyed
to York, and likewise committed to the
castle. At the Lent assizes following,
the prosecutors were not ready with
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_5">5</span>
their evidence; on which he was remanded
till the summer assizes, when
he was brought to trial.</p>

<p>When Houseman had given his evidence
respecting this extraordinary affair,
and all such collateral testimony
had been taken as could be adduced on
such an occasion, Aram was called on
for his defence; but, having foreseen
that the perturbation of his spirits would
incapacitate him to make such a defence
without previous preparation, he had
written the following, which, by permission,
he read in <span class="lock">court:—</span></p>

<p>“My Lord:—I know not whether it
is of right, or through some indulgence
of your lordship, that I am allowed the
liberty at this bar to attempt a defence,
incapable and uninstructed as I am, to
speak. Since, while I see so many
eyes upon me, so numerous and awful a
concourse, fixed with attention, and filled
with—I know not what expectancy, I
labor not with guilt, my lord, but with perplexity.
For having never seen a court
but this—being wholly unacquainted
with law—the customs of the bar, and
all judiciary proceedings, I fear I shall
be so little capable of speaking with propriety
in this place, that it exceeds my
hope if I shall be able to speak at all.</p>

<p>“I have heard, my lord, the indictment
read, wherein I find myself charged
with the highest crime—with an enormity
which I am altogether incapable of—to
the commission of which, there goes
far more insensibility of heart, more
profligacy of morals, than ever fell to my
lot. And nothing possibly could have
admitted a presumption of this nature,
but a depravity not inferior to that imputed
to me. However, as I stand indicted
at your lordship’s bar, and have
heard what is called evidence adduced in
support of such a charge, I very humbly
solicit your lordship’s patience, and beg
the hearing of this respectable audience,
while I, single and unskilful—destitute
of friends, and unassisted by counsel,
say something perhaps like argument
in my defence. I shall consume but
little of your lordship’s time. What
I have to say, will be short, and this
brevity, probably, will be the best part
of it; however, it is offered with all possible
regard, and the greatest submission
to your lordship’s consideration, and that
of this honorable court.</p>

<p>“First, my lord, the whole tenor of my
conduct in life contradicts every particular
of this indictment. Yet, I had never
said this, did not my present circumstances
extort it from me, and seem to
make it necessary. Permit me here,
my lord, to call upon malignity itself, so
long and cruelly busied in this prosecution,
to charge upon me any immorality
of which prejudice was not the author.
No, my lord, I concerted no scheme of
fraud; projected no violence, injured no
man’s person or private property; my
days were honestly laborious, my nights
intensely studious. And I humbly conceive
my notice of this, especially at this
time, will not be thought impertinent
or unseasonable, but at least deserving
some attention; because, my Lord, that
any person, after a temperate use of life,
a series of thinking and acting regularly,
without one single deviation from sobriety,
should plunge into the very depth
of profligacy, precipitately, and at once,
is altogether improbable and unprecedented,
and absolutely inconsistent with
the course of things. Mankind is never
corrupted at once; villany is always
progressive, and declines from right, step
after step, till every regard of probity is
lost, and every sense of all moral obligation
totally perishes.</p>

<p>“Again, my lord, a suspicion of this
kind, which nothing but malevolence
could entertain and ignorance propagate,
is violently opposed by my very situation
at that time, with respect to health; for,
but a little space before, I was confined to
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_6">6</span>
my bed, and suffered under a very long
and severe disorder, and was not able,
for half a year together, so much as to
walk. The distemper left me, indeed,
yet slowly and in part; but so macerated,
so enfeebled, that I was reduced to
crutches; and so far from being well
about the time I am charged with the
fact, that I never, to this day, have perfectly
recovered. Could then a person
in this condition, take anything into his
head so extravagant? I, past the vigor
of my age, feeble and valetudinary, with
no inducement to engage, with no ability
to accomplish, no weapon wherewith to
perpetrate such a feat; without interest,
without power, without motive, without
means.</p>

<p>“Besides, it must need occur to every
one, that an action of this atrocious nature
is never heard of, but, when its
springs are laid open, it appears that
it was to support some indolence, or
supply some luxury; to satisfy some
avarice, or oblige some malice; to prevent
some real or some imaginary want:
yet I lay not under the influence of
any of these. Surely, my lord, I may,
consistently with both truth and modesty,
affirm this much; and none who have
any veracity, and know me, will ever
question it.</p>

<p>“In the second place, the disappearance
of Clarke is suggested as an argument
of his being dead; but the uncertainty
of such an inference from that,
and the fallibility of all conclusions of
such a sort, from such a circumstance,
are too obvious and too notorious, to
require instances; yet, superseding many,
permit me to procure a very recent
one, and that afforded by this castle.</p>

<p>“In June, 1757, William Thompson,
for all the vigilance of this place, in
open day-light, and double-ironed, made
his escape; and, notwithstanding an immediate
inquiry set on foot, the strictest
search and all advertisement, was never
seen or heard of since. If, then, Thompson
got off unseen through all these difficulties,
how very easy was it for Clarke,
when none of them opposed him? But
what would be thought of a prosecution
commenced against any one seen last
with Thompson?</p>

<p>“Permit me next, my lord, to observe a
little upon the bones which have been
discovered. It is said, which perhaps
is saying very far, that these are the
skeleton of a man. It is possible, indeed,
they may; but is there any certain
criterion, which incontestably distinguishes
the sex in human bones?
Let it be considered, my lord, whether
the ascertaining this point ought not to
precede any attempt to identify them.</p>

<p>“The place of their depositum, too,
claims much more attention than is commonly
bestowed upon it; for of all places
in the world none could have mentioned
any one, wherein there was greater certainty
of finding human bones than a hermitage,
except he should point out a
church-yard; hermitages, in times past,
being not only places of religious retirement,
but of burial too. And it has scarce
or never been heard of, but that every cell
now known, contains or contained these
relics of humanity, some mutilated and
some entire. I do not inform, but give
me leave to remind your lordship, that
here sat solitary sanctity, and here the
hermit or the anchoress, who hoped for
that repose to their bones, when dead,
which they here enjoyed when living.</p>

<p>“All the while, my lord, I am sensible
this is known to your lordship and
many in this court, better than to me.
But it seems necessary to my case, that
others who have not at all, perhaps, adverted
to things of this nature, and may
take an interest in my trial, should be
made acquainted with it. Suffer me,
then, my lord, to produce a few of many
evidences, that these cells were used as
repositories of the dead, and to enumerate
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_7">7</span>
a few in which human bones have
been found, as it happened in this question;
lest to some that accident might
seem extraordinary, and, consequently,
occasion prejudice.</p>

<p>“1st. The bones, as was supposed of
the Saxon, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dubritius, were discovered
buried in his cell, at Guy’s Cliff,
near Warwick, as appears from the authority
of Sir William Dugdale.</p>

<p>“<abbr title="Second">2d.</abbr> The bones, thought to be those
of the anchoress Rosia, were but lately
discovered in a cell at Royston, entire,
fair, and undecayed, though they must
have lain interred for several centuries,
as is proved by Dr. Stukeley.</p>

<p>“<abbr title="Third">3d.</abbr> But my own country, nay,
almost this neighborhood, supplies another
instance, for, in January, 1747,
were found, by Mr. Stovin, accompanied
by a reverend gentleman, the bones in
part of some recluse, in the cell at Lindholm,
near Hatfield. They were supposed
to be those of William of Lindholm,
a hermit, who had long made this
cave his habitation.</p>

<p>“4th. In February, 1744, part of Woburn
abbey being pulled down, a large
portion of a corpse appeared, even with
the flesh on, which bore cutting with a
knife; though it is certain this had lain
above two hundred years, and how much
longer is doubtful; for the abbey was
founded in 1145, and dissolved in 1538
or 39.</p>

<p>“What would have been said, what
believed, if this had been an accident to
the bones in question?</p>

<p>“Farther, my lord, it is not yet out of
living memory, that a little distance
from Knaresborough, in a field, part of
the manor of the worthy and patriotic
baronet who does that borough the honor
to represent it in parliament, were
found, in digging for gravel, not one
human skeleton only, but five or six,
deposited side by side, with each an
urn placed at its head, as your lordship
knows was usual in ancient interments.</p>

<p>“About the same time, and in another
field, almost close to this borough, was
discovered also, in searching for gravel,
another human skeleton; but the piety
of the same worthy gentleman ordered
both pits to be filled up again, commendably
unwilling to disturb the dead.</p>

<p>“Is the invention of these bones forgotten,
then, or industriously concealed, that
the discovery of those in question may
appear the more singular and extraordinary?
whereas, in fact, there is nothing
extraordinary in it. My lord, almost
every place conceals such remains. In
fields, in hills, in highway sides, in
commons, lie frequent and unsuspected
bones. And our present allotments for
rest for the departed, are but of some centuries.</p>

<p>“Another particular seems not to
claim a little of your lordship’s notice,
and that of the gentlemen of the jury;
which is, that perhaps no example occurs
of more than one skeleton being
found in one cell; and in the cell in
question was found but one; agreeable,
in this, to the peculiarity of every other
known cell in Britain. Not the invention
of one skeleton, but of two, would
have appeared suspicious and uncommon.</p>

<p>“But it seems another skeleton has
been discovered by some laborer, which
was full as confidently averred to be
Clarke’s as this. My lord, must some
of the living, if it promotes some interest,
be made answerable for all the bones
that earth has concealed, and chance exposed?
and might not a place where
bones lay, be mentioned by a person by
chance, as well as found by a laborer by
chance? or is it more criminal accidentally
to name where bones lie, than accidentally
to find where they lie?</p>

<p>“Here, too, is a human skull produced,
which is fractured; but was this the cause,
or was it the consequence of death? was
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_8">8</span>
it owing to violence, or was it the effect
of natural decay? If it was violence,
was it before or after death? My lord,
in May, 1732, the remains of William,
lord archbishop of this province, were
taken up, by permission, in this cathedral,
and the bones of the skull were
found broken; yet certainly he died by
no violence offered to him alive, that
could occasion that fracture there.</p>

<p>“Let it be considered, my lord, that
upon the dissolution of religious houses,
and the commencement of the reformation,
the ravages of those times affected
both the living and the dead. In search
after imaginary treasures, coffins were
broken up, graves and vaults dug open,
monuments ransacked, and shrines demolished;
and it ceased about the beginning
of the reign of queen Elizabeth.
I entreat your lordship, suffer not the
violences, the depredations, and iniquities
of those times to be imputed to
this.</p>

<p>“Moreover, what gentleman is ignorant
that Knaresborough had a castle;
which, though now a ruin, was once
considerable, both for its strength and
garrison? All know it was vigorously
besieged by the arms of parliament; at
which siege, in sallies, conflicts, flights,
pursuits, many fell in the places round
it, and where they fell, were buried; for
every place, my lord, is burial earth in
war; and many, questionless, of these,
rest yet unknown, whose bones futurity

<p>“I hope, with all imaginable submission,
that what has been said will not be
thought impertinent to this indictment;
and that it will be far from the wisdom,
the learning, and the integrity of this
place, to impute to the living, what zeal
in its fury may have done; what nature
may have done; what nature may have
taken off, and piety interred; or what
war alone may have destroyed, alone
deposited.</p>

<p>“As to the circumstances that have
been raked together, I have nothing to
observe, but that all circumstances whatever,
are precarious, and have too frequently
been found lamentably fallible;
even the strongest have failed. They
may rise to the utmost degree of probability,
yet they are but probability still.
Why need I name to your lordship the
two Harrisons, recorded by Dr. Howel,
who both suffered upon circumstances,
because of the sudden disappearance of
their lodger, who was in credit, had contracted
debts, borrowed money, and went
off unseen, and returned a great many
years after their execution? Why name
the intricate affair of Jacques de Moulin,
under king Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, related by a gentleman
who was counsel for the crown?
and why the unhappy Coleman, who
suffered innocent, though convicted upon
positive evidence, and whose children
perished for want, because the world
uncharitably believed the father guilty?
Why mention the perjury of Smith, incautiously
admitted king’s evidence,
who, to screen himself, equally accused
Faircloth and Loveday of the murder
of Dunn; the first of whom, in 1749,
was executed at Winchester; and Loveday
was about to suffer at Reading, had
not Smith been proved to be perjured, to
the satisfaction of the court, by the surgeon
of the Gosport hospital?</p>

<p>“Now, my lord, having endeavored to
show that the whole of this process is
altogether repugnant to every part of my
life; that it is inconsistent with my condition
of health about that time; that no
rational inference can be drawn that a
person is dead who suddenly disappears;
that hermitages were the constant repositories
of the bones of the recluse; that
the revolutions in religion, or the fortunes
of war, have mangled or buried the dead;
the conclusion remains, perhaps no less
reasonably than impatiently wished for.
I, at last, after a year’s confinement,
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_9">9</span>
equal to either fortune, put myself upon
the candor, the justice, and the humanity
of your lordship, and upon yours, my
countrymen, gentlemen of the jury.”</p>

<p>Aram was tried by Judge Noel, who,
having remarked that this defence was
one of the most ingenious pieces of reasoning
that had ever fallen under his
notice, summed up the evidence to the
jury, who gave a verdict of guilty; in
consequence of which he received sentence
of death.</p>

<p>After conviction, a clergyman was
appointed to attend him, and to exhort
him to an ample confession. Aram appeared
to pay proper attention to what
was said, but after the minister had retired,
he formed the resolution of destroying
himself; and when the morning
appointed for his execution arrived, the
keeper, on proceeding to take him out
of his cell, was surprised to find him
almost expiring through loss of blood,
having cut his left arm, above the elbow
and near the wrist, with a razor. A
surgeon being sent for, stopped the bleeding;
but when he was taken to the place
of execution, he was so very weak as to
be unable to join in devotion with the
clergyman who attended him.</p>

<p>On the table in his cell was found the
following paper, containing his reasons
for attempting to commit suicide:—“What
am I better than my fathers? To
die is natural and necessary. Perfectly
sensible of this, I fear no more to die
than I did to be born. But the manner
of it is something which should, in my
opinion, be decent and manly. I think
I have regarded both these points. Certainly
nobody has a better right to dispose
of man’s life than himself; and he,
not others, should determine how. As
for any indignities offered to my body,
or silly reflections on my faith and
morals, they are, as they always were,
things indifferent to me. I think, though
contrary to the common way of thinking,
I wrong no man by this, and hope it is
not offensive to the eternal Being that
formed me and the world: and as by
this, I injure no man, no man can reasonably
be offended. I solicitously recommend
myself to the eternal and
almighty Being, the God of nature, if I
have done amiss. But perhaps I have
not; and I hope this thing will never be
imputed to me. Though I am now
stained by malevolence, and suffer by
prejudice, I hope to rise fair and unblemished.
My life was not polluted, my morals
were irreproachable, and my opinions
orthodox. I slept sound till three o’clock,
awaked, and wrote these <span class="lock">lines:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p>In some of the accounts published of
Aram’s trial, a letter is quoted, as written
to one of his friends, confessing his
guilt; but this document is understood
to have been forged for the purpose of
pleasing the illiterate jurymen who condemned
him, and who were incapable
of appreciating the admirable reasoning
contained in his defence. He was executed
near York, on the 6th of August,
1759, and afterwards hung in chains in
Knaresborough forest.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
Bald Eagle.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> White-headed or Bald Eagle is
spread over nearly the whole northern
part of America, but abounds particularly
near the falls of Niagara, where it
subsists on fish and on such animals as
are accidentally floated down the stream.
It also feeds upon pigs, lambs, fawns,
and other small animals that it can overpower.
It builds its nest on the top of a
tall tree, of sticks, weeds, and moss.
The young are usually three in number,
and do not, like many other birds, leave
the nest till they are fully fledged. The
parent birds are very fierce in their defence,
and feed them with the greatest
assiduity.</p>

<p>This splendid bird is about three feet
long, and seven feet from the tip of one
wing to the other. The head, neck and
tail are pure white, the rest of the plumage
is nearly black. The representation
of the Bald Eagle forms the national
emblem of the United States. The mode
in which this bird obtains his prey is
thus graphically described by Audubon.
The scene is in Mississippi, and the
eagle is perched on the top of the tallest
tree, on the margin of the stream.</p>

<p>“The wild, trumpet-like sound of a
yet distant but approaching swan is
heard. The eagle shakes the whole of
his body, and with a few touches of his
bill, he arranges his plumage in an instant.
The snow-white bird is now in
sight; her long neck is stretched forward;
her eye is on the watch, vigilant as that
of her enemy; her large wings seem with
difficulty to support the weight of her
body, although they flap incessantly. So
irksome do her exertions seem, that her
legs are spread beneath her tail to aid
her flight. She approaches, however.
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_11">11</span>
The eagle has marked her for his prey.
As the swan is passing, he starts from
his perch, in full preparation for the
chase, with an awful scream, that, to the
swan’s ear, brings more terror than the
report of the large duck-gun.</p>

<p>“Now is the moment to witness the
eagle’s powers. He glides through the
air like a falling star, and like a flash of
lightning comes upon the timorous quarry,
which now, in agony and despair,
seeks, by various manœuvres, to elude
the grasp of his cruel talons; it mounts,
doubles, and willingly would plunge
into the stream, were it not prevented by
the eagle, which, long possessed of the
knowledge that by such a stratagem the
swan might escape him, forces it to remain
in the air by attempting to strike it
with its talons from beneath.</p>

<p>“The hope of escape is soon given up
by the swan. It has already become
much weakened, and its strength fails at
the sight of the courage and strength of
its antagonist. Its last gasp is about to
escape, when the ferocious eagle strikes
with his talons the under side of its
wing, and, with unresisted power, forces
the bird to fall in a slanting direction
upon the nearest shore. He presses
down his powerful feet, and drives his
sharp claws deep into the heart of the
dying swan. He then, with his mate,
gorges himself with the blood of the
luckless victim.”</p>

<h2>
Gallantry in a Dog.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following anecdote, told by Mr. B.
S. Johnson, is very curious, as evincing
another proof of the sagacity of the dog.</p>

<p>“When twelve years old, my dog had
attained a greater size and strength than
ordinary, and, prior to this period, had
shown many indications of astonishing
sagacity. He had become exceedingly
attached to the female part of my family,

and particularly to the children. A little
daughter, a child about six years old,
attended a school at the distance of
quarter of a mile, to which the dog uniformly
accompanied her every morning,
as well as at noon; and as soon as he
had conducted his charge safely into the
house, he returned home.</p>

<p>“Pursuing this system for a short time,
he was soon not content with guarding
the child to school, but began to escort
her home. Twelve o’clock was the
hour at which the children left the
school, for the purpose of returning home
to dinner; a few minutes before which,
Frank,—for that was the name by which
the animal was distinguished,—trotted
away, with elevated tail, and placing
himself in front of the school, waited
patiently till the little throng came out,
when he eagerly selected his charge,
and guarded her home with all the pride
imaginable.</p>

<p>“At five o’clock in the afternoon, a similar
scene took place. It was amusing,
indeed it was highly interesting, to witness
the performance of these operations,
by this sagacious and affectionate creature.
I have many times watched it
with unspeakable pleasure. About ten
minutes before twelve and five o’clock,
(how the creature contrived to calculate
the time so accurately, I am not able to
say,) Frank left my premises, and in a
minute or two appeared before the door
of the school, where, squat on his
haunches, he attentively waited the
opening of the door.</p>

<p>“On such occasions, the children are
crowded together, and Frank might now
be observed among them busily employed
in selecting his charge. Dogs never
appear fully satisfied of the identity of
any one, till they have exercised their
olfactory organs, as well as their orbs of
vision, on the subject of their solicitude;
and therefore Frank always took a few
grateful sniffs before he took his order
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_12">12</span>
of march, which was a few yards in advance,
with elevated tail, and evidently
in all the pride of satisfactory duty.</p>

<p>“On the appearance of any person or
animal from which danger was to be
apprehended, the dog came close to the
child, and forbade near approach; he
was particularly suspicious of the proximity
of a beggar, or any mean or ruffianly
person.”</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
Charon.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a former number, we have given
some account of the heathen deities: we
must now say a few words of old Charon,
whom the ancients considered one of the
gods of Hell. He was supposed to be
the son of Erebus or Darkness, and
Nox or Night,—and his duty was to
conduct the souls of the dead in a boat
over the river Styx, to the infernal regions.
He was, therefore, a ferryman,
and received a penny for each passenger.
Such souls, however, as had not been
honored with a funeral, were not permitted
to enter Charon’s boat, without
previously wandering on the shore for
one hundred years. Accordingly, the
ancients thought it a dreadful thing to
have no burial.</p>

<p>If the soul of any person presented himself
to cross the Stygian river, he could
not be admitted before he showed Charon
a golden bough, which he had received
from the Sibyl. This law was so strict,
that Charon was once imprisoned for a
year, because he ferried over Hercules,
without the passport. It did not matter
that he was forced to do it by the
hero.</p>

<p>Charon is represented in the ancient
descriptions as an old robust man, with
a hideous countenance, long white beard,
and piercing eyes. His garment is ragged
and filthy, and his forehead is covered
with wrinkles. As all the dead
were obliged to pay a small piece of
money for their admission to the boat,
it was always usual among the ancients
to place under the tongue of the deceased
a piece of money for Charon.</p>

<p>This fable of Charon and his boat,
which became a part of the religious
creed of the Greeks and Romans, was
borrowed from the Egyptians, whose
dead were carried across a lake, where
sentence was passed upon them, and, according
to their good or bad actions,
they were honored with a splendid burial,
or left unnoticed in the open air.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">
A Civilized Bear.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> New Hampshire, a species of bear
is found, black in color, small in size,
and in general of a peaceable disposition.
These animals live on wild honey and
fruits, and never attack man or the lesser
animals, except when pressed by hunger,
in the very severe winters. On one
occasion, some years ago, a boy found a
very young bear pup near Lake Winnipeg,
and carried it home with him. It
was fed and brought up about the house
of the boy’s father, and became as tame
as a dog.</p>

<p>Every day its youthful captor had to
go to school at some distance, and, by
degrees, the bear became his daily companion.
At first the other scholars were
shy of the creature’s acquaintance, but
ere long it became their regular playfellow,
and they delighted in sharing
with it the little store of provisions,
which they brought for their day’s sustenance
in small bags. After two years
of civilization, however, the bear wandered
to the woods, and did not return.
Search was made for him, but in vain.</p>

<p>Four succeeding years passed away,
and in the interval, changes had occurred
in the school alluded to. An old dame
had succeeded to the ancient master, and
a new generation of pupils had taken
the place of the former ones. One very
cold winter day, while the schoolmistress
was busy with her humble lessons, a boy
chanced to leave the door half way open
on his entrance, and suddenly a large
bear walked in.</p>

<p>The consternation of the old lady and
her boys and girls, was unspeakable.
Both schoolmistress and pupils would
fain have been “abroad,” but the bear
was in the path, and all that could be
done was to fly off as far as possible,
behind the tables and benches. But
the bear troubled nobody. He walked
quietly up to the fireplace, and warmed
himself, exhibiting much satisfaction in
his countenance during the process.</p>

<p>He remained thus about a quarter of
an hour, and then walked up to the wall
where the provender bags and baskets
of the pupils were suspended. Standing
on his hind feet, he then took hold of
these successively, put his paws into
them, and made free with the bread,
fruit, and other eatables therein contained.
He next tried the schoolmistress’s
desk, where some little provisions
usually were; but finding it firmly shut,
he went up again to the fire, and after a
few minutes’ stay before it, he walked
out by the way he came in.</p>

<p>As soon as the schoolmistress and her
pupils had courage to move, the alarm
was given to the neighbors. Several
young men immediately started after the
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_14">14</span>
bear, and as its track was perfectly visible
upon the snow, they soon came up
with it and killed it. Then it was that,
by certain marks upon its skin, some of
its pursuers recognised in the poor bear
no enemy, but an old friend of their own
recent school days. Great regret was
felt at the loss of the creature. It was
like killing a human friend, rather than
a wild animal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> of the finest scenery in this
country is found on the banks of the
Hudson river; but the <em>Palisadoes</em>, as
they are called, are not only beautiful,
they are indeed one of the curiosities of
nature. They consist of steep rocks,
formed like a vast wall, and constituting
the western bank of the river, from
twelve to twenty miles above the city of
New York.</p>

<p>As you pass by in the steamboat, the
Palisadoes cannot fail to excite your
wonder. Though the rocks are so high
as to seem almost like mountains, yet
they are often so regular as to look like
works of art. You can hardly persuade
yourself, indeed, that they are not cut
by the hand of man. If, however, you
go upon these rocks, you will see that
they are too vast a work for any other

<h2>
A real Hero.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> inundation having taken
place in the north of Italy, owing to an
excessive fall of snow in the Alps, followed
by a speedy thaw, the river Adige
carried off a bridge near Verona, except
the middle part, on which was the house
of the toll-gatherer, or porter, I forget
which, and who, with his whole family,
thus remained imprisoned by the waves,
and in momentary danger of destruction.</p>

<p>They were discovered, stretching forth
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_15">15</span>
their hands, screaming and imploring
succor, while fragments of the remaining
arch were continually falling into the
water. In this extreme danger, a nobleman
who was present, held out a purse
of one hundred sequins, as a reward to
any adventurer who would take a boat,
and deliver this unhappy family. But
the risk was so great of being borne
down by the rapidity of the stream,
or being dashed against the fragments
of the bridge, or of being crushed by the
falling stones, that not one, in the vast
number of spectators, had courage
enough to attempt such an exploit.</p>

<p>A peasant passing along was informed
of the proposed reward. Immediately
jumping into a boat, he, by strength of
oars, gained the middle of the river,
brought his boat under the pile, and the
whole family safely descended by means
of a rope. “Courage,” cried he; “now
you are safe.” By a still more strenuous
effort, and great strength of arm, he
brought the family and boat to shore.</p>

<p>“Brave fellow!” exclaimed the count,
handing the purse to him; “here is the
promised recompense.” “I shall never
expose my life for money,” said the
peasant. “My labor is a sufficient livelihood
for myself, my wife and my children.
Give the purse to this poor family,
who have lost all!”</p>

A Revolutionary Story.<br>
</h2>
<h3>
<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="One"><span class="allsmcap">I.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A little</span> to the west of the point where
Connecticut river pours itself into Long
Island Sound, lies a small, circular piece
of land, called Duck Island. It is some
two miles in circuit, and perhaps two
miles from the shore, which here consists
of the fine old town of Saybrook.</p>

<p>It is now about seventy years since
this place was the seat of a hospital for
the small-pox. At that period the kinepox,
since employed to check the most
fearful and formidable disease that ever
afflicted mankind, was unknown. The
only mitigation of small-pox was obtained
by inoculation, which produced the disease
in a milder form. Those who
caught it by infection, or had it the natural
way, to use the common phrase of
that period, were always supposed to be
in imminent danger of losing their lives.</p>

<p>The hospital of Duck island was therefore
resorted to by persons who wished
to be inoculated for the small-pox. The
reason for selecting such a situation was,
that no danger of the infection could arise
when there were no inhabitants near.</p>

<p>The island itself was originally a barren,
sandy knoll, without trees; but the
proprietor, Dr. Joinly, had taken pains
to cultivate and embellish it, and, at the
time of which we speak, it possessed a
fertile and inviting aspect. Two large
and handsome buildings, with a variety
of out-houses, were erected upon the island,
and furnished accommodations for
the patients of the hospital. The establishment
had acquired great reputation,
arising from the high professional standing
of the proprietor, and the admirable
manner in which it was conducted.
Nearly a hundred patients were constantly
in the hospital, which, with the
necessary attendants, made the little
island seem like a small city in the
midst of the sea.</p>

<p>It might seem that an institution so
benignant in its operation should find
shelter even from the ravages of war;
but it was not so. The revolutionary
struggle commenced in 1775, and soon
pervaded the whole country. The British
fleet, under Lord Howe, fled from
Boston in the spring of 1776, and in the
course of the summer, after severe fighting,
New York fell into the hands of the
enemy. Long Island Sound was soon
occupied by British ships of war. The
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_16">16</span>
hospital on Duck Island was respected
for a time,—as much, perhaps, from a
fear of infection, as from sentiments of
humanity. But this at last fell a victim
to the ruthless spirit which animated the
foe.</p>

<p>A British ship of war was one day
passing near the island. In mere wantonness
she opened her battery, and the
deadly cannon shot came ploughing up
the soil and rending the out-buildings of
the hospital. All within the establishment
was instantly converted into confusion
and uproar. The sick patients
leaped from their beds and fled screaming
through the passages; while shot after
shot now struck the houses, and, piercing
them through and through, rendered
the whole a scene of indescribable terror
and misery. Two or three children were
killed, and their blood was spattered
upon the walls of the rooms where patients
lay, too sick to move from their
beds. Some expired from fright, while
others, almost naked, and wasted to a
shadow, leaped up in frenzy and went
raving forth into the open air.</p>

<p>We need not dwell upon this fearful
scene, which is only one of the common
fruits of the great game of war—a game
which has made Alexander and Cæsar
and Napoleon so glorious. Dr. Joinly
did everything in his power to calm his
agitated patients, but in vain. The time
of trial was, however, short; the commander
of the ship of war only desired
to clear out his guns, which had been
loaded for some time, and when he had
done this, and had some fine sport, he
and his iron battery passed on. What
was sport to him, however, was agony
and death to others. The hospital of
Duck Island was destroyed; the buildings
were torn to rags by the cannon shot;
several persons were killed outright, and
others died of agitation and exposure.
It was in vain to think of continuing the
establishment, when it was exposed to
occurrences like this; the patients were
removed to the main land, the island was
deserted, and the buildings were left to
moulder into dust.</p>

<p>It was scenes like this, proceeding
from the wanton cruelty of the British
forces, that roused the American people
to resistance, and united them, heart to
heart, for liberty or death. The feelings
which the British officers brought to this
country, were composed of hatred and
contempt; they hated us as rebels, and
despised us as Yankees, which, in their
ignorant prejudice, meant everything
mean and cowardly. They made war
upon us, as the sportsman pursues noxious
game, which it is a pleasure not only
to kill, but to worry, irritate and torment.
The attack upon the hospital of Duck
Island no doubt passed for a good joke
among the British officers; but if so, it
was a joke somewhat dearly bought, as
we shall see.</p>

<p>The indignation of the people of Saybrook,
and indeed of the people generally
along the Connecticut shore, on
account of the destruction of the hospital,
knew no bounds. A movement was
immediately made to raise a body of
troops, and despatch them against the
enemy, now quartered upon Long Island.
A regiment was soon assembled, and
Dr. Joinly was chosen as colonel. Their
proceedings we shall relate in <a href="#v6P100">another
chapter</a>.</p>

<h2>
Having a Good Time.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the opposite page is seen an engraving
from one of the pictures of the
celebrated Scotch painter, David Wilkie.
This artist was a faithful painter of
scenes in rustic life; he represented
things, honestly, as they are—and he
has here given us a picture of what may
be called <em>Having a good time</em>; a very
common and familiar incident, in many
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_18">18</span>
countries. And what is this <em>having a
good time</em>?

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Look at that man in the picture—by
the side of the horse-trough—beastly
drunk. Reader, man is an immortal
being; he has a soul, destined to live
forever; and yet such a being has found
the art of making himself, soul and body,
that disgusting thing which you see in
the picture. And this is called <em>having
a good time</em>!</p>

<p>Alas, how fearfully has society strayed
in the path of error, to have reached this
point! That drunkenness should be
thought happiness; and that scenes of
this kind should have become so familiar
and so little disgusting, as to be selected
by the painter with a view to pleasure
the world—is a fearful evidence of the
strength and pervading nature of those
bonds under which a dreadful vice has
laid society.</p>

<p>The truth, however, is beginning to
manifest itself. That intoxicating liquors
are poisonous; that drunkenness is
an abomination; that temperance is the
path to health and wealth, to happiness
here and hereafter, are truths now beginning
to be felt by every member of
society. Who is there, among us, so
dead to truth, so indifferent to human
happiness, as not to join heart and hand
in the glorious cause of temperance; that
great cause which aims at the banishment
of the most fruitful sources of human
misery; and which aims at the
elevation of man to that dignity, peace
and happiness for which his Creator,
when he formed him after his own image,
designed him!</p>

<p>Reader, there is an old-fashioned
mode, adopted by the pilgrim fathers of
New England, to determine what is
right and what is wrong. Anything,
said they, is wrong, for the success of
which we cannot pray to God. Let us
apply this in the present case. Can
any one pray for the success of the grog-shop?

Can any one pray for the success
of the bar-room—the tippling room?
Can any one pray for the success of the
distillery? Can any one pray for the
success of the wine cellar—the brandy
trade—the rum voyage? What does
the success of these things mean? Their
success means the degradation of mankind;
the destruction of soul and body;
the gradual preparing of human beings
to commit crimes—theft, burglary, robbery
and murder; the preparation of human
beings to become insane—to be the
victims of disease—to be outcasts and
paupers. The success of the rum trade—the
wine trade—the cider trade—in
all their forms, retail and wholesale,
means all this. Who, then, can pray to
God for the success of these trades? and
who will venture to promote or follow
a system which they know excites the
frown of Heaven, and must finally bring
the curse of mankind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> is the picture of this month,
drawn by an old English poet. With us
the heat is still greater than in England;
yet the farmers keep busily at work in the
fields; and, to say truth, it is about as
comfortable to be at work as to be idle.
You see in the picture that our fat friend,
who is only looking on, wipes his face
and seems as hot as those who are in
the field at work, hoeing the corn.</p>

<p>Leigh Hunt, an elegant English writer,
says: “The heat is greatest during
this month, on account of its duration.
There is a sense of heat and quiet all
over nature. The birds are silent.
The little brooks are dried up. The
earth is parched. The shadows of the
trees are particularly grateful, heavy
and still. The oaks, which are freshest
because latest in leaf, form noble, clumpy
canopies, looking, as you lie under them,
of a strong, emulous green, against the
blue sky. The traveller delights to cut
across the country, through the fields
and the leafy lanes, where, nevertheless,
the flints sparkle with heat. The cattle
get into the shade or stand in the water.
The active and air-cutting swallows
now beginning to assemble for migration,
seek their prey among the shady
places, where the insects, though of differently
compounded natures, ‘fleshless
and bloodless,’ seem to get for coolness,
as they do at other times for warmth.
The sound of insects is likewise the
only audible sound now, increasing rather
than lessening the sense of quiet, by
its gentle contrast. The bee now and
then sweeps across the ear with his
gravest tone.”</p>

<p>On the 24th of this month commence
the dog-days, which are a number of days
preceding and following the rise of Sirius,
or the dog-star, in the morning. There
were formerly many superstitions concerning
the dog-star. Some old authors
say, that “On the first day that this star
rises in the morning, the sea boils, wine
turns sour, dogs begin to grow mad, all
animals feel languid, and the diseases it
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_20">20</span>
occasions in men are fevers, frenzies and
hysterics.” The Romans used to sacrifice
a brown dog, every year, to the dog-star,
on his first rising, to appease his
rage. The heat of the weather during
the dog-days is very great; the sun
darts his rays almost perpendicularly
upon the earth, and some diseases are
consequently at that time more to be
dreaded. But the exaggerated effects
of the rising of Sirius are quite groundless.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>The beginning.—My earliest recollections.—My
home.—My parents.—A fearful scene.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Kind</span> reader, as you and I are about
to take a ramble together, I beg leave to
settle one or two points at the outset. In
the first place, then, I shall tell you my
story in a very simple, plain way; for
the circumstances of my life have qualified
me to speak in no other fashion.
In the next place, I shall endeavor to
make my story the means of giving you
some useful information. I have been
a wanderer over the Far West; have
seen the rivers, the mountains, the valleys,
the wild animals, the tribes of Indians
that are there; I have crossed the
Rocky Mountains, and stood upon the
shore of the broad Pacific; and I have
thus picked up a good deal of information.
While, therefore, I shall give you
an account of my adventures, I shall endeavor
to make you acquainted with
some matters relating to the geography,
the natural history, and the manners and
customs of the great West. Thus, while
I shall try to amuse you, I will try also
to give you some little knowledge. I
hope this arrangement will suit you; for
if I give you <em>cake</em>, to which I compare
tales of adventure, you should be content
to take, now and then, a slice of solid
<em>bread and butter</em>, to which I compare
such useful matters as geography and
natural history.</p>

<p>And now to begin. At the period of
my earliest recollection, I must have
been about six years old. My father
was then living on the White river,
about one hundred miles west of the
Mississippi, and in what is now the
state of Arkansas. His house, which
was only a log cabin, was four or five
miles from any other white man’s dwelling.
There was no town or village in
that quarter; excepting a few scattered
settlers here and there, the country was
still uninhabited, except by native wild
animals, or roving tribes of Indians.</p>

<p>The latter were at peace with the
whites for a long period, and therefore
we had no fear of them. We frequently
saw parties of Indian hunters, and
occasionally considerable numbers came
into the region where we dwelt. They
often visited our cabin, but never gave
us any annoyance. But the time arrived
when a change took place. We
heard fearful stories of Indian massacres,
and more than one family, in the
region where we lived, were entirely cut
off.</p>

<p>I remember that one night my father
came home and told my mother that
a party of Kickapoos had been in the
neighborhood and killed every member
of the family which lived nearest to us.
He, of course, expected they would be
upon us before morning. What was
now to be done? The number of the
savages was over a dozen, and it seemed
quite hopeless to attempt either resistance
or escape. If we were to fortify
the house, we might make a brief defence,
and kill a few of the enemy, but
we must yield at last, and fall into the
hands of our exasperated foe. If we
were to fly, the savages, keen as bloodhounds
in following their prey, would
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_21">21</span>
soon track us out, and we should become
their easy victims.</p>

<p>People who are brought up in quiet
and secure towns, free from the dangers
of the wilderness, and who only hear of
adventures with the Indians, can hardly
appreciate the feelings of those who are
inured to every species of danger and
trial. I remember the looks of my father
and mother upon that fearful night,
when they expected the savages to be
upon their dwelling in a few hours, and
to see themselves and their children become
the victims of their bloody vengeance.
They were brave people, and,
though their countenances looked troubled,
there was more of courage than
fear in their faces.</p>

<p>There were four of us children: my
brother Dick, about fourteen years old;
my sister Jane, two years younger, and
little Harry, a year younger than myself.
The decision of our parents being
to fortify the house and make the best
defence in their power, we were all, except
Harry, employed in the preparations.
The latter was the only one who
did not comprehend what was going on.
While the rest of us were busy in bringing
in the axes, hoes, spades, and other
implements capable of being used for a
deadly encounter, Harry was running
about, seeming to enjoy the flurry and
rejoice in the spirit of activity that animated
the scene.</p>

<p>Everything that could be done was
at last accomplished. The windows
were strongly barred; the door was barricadoed;
the wide-mouthed chimney,
down which an Indian might easily have
slid, was defended by large sticks crossed
and jammed into the crevices of the stone
work of the fire-place. Near the door
sat our dog, Tiger; he was stretched
upon his belly at full length on the
floor, with his chin between his extended
fore legs. He was not asleep, for it was
evident that he understood that something
fearful was in the wind. An
erect forecorner of his ear showed that
he was listening intently; and his eye,
steadily bent toward the door, betokened
the expectation of danger in that direction.</p>

<p>My father loaded the old gun, now
our chief hope, with care; he picked the
flint, examined the priming, looked at his
stock of powder and ball; and now, as
if everything was prepared, sat down.
I remember how he looked, when he
now turned round and viewed my mother
and us children. I remember how she
looked too. My father’s lips trembled,
and his eyes seemed to grow dim, for he
lifted his hand and brushed it across his
brow; but in a moment he looked again
at his priming, glanced at old Tiger, and
fixed his eye on the door and sat still.
His face now became as stern as marble.
My mother sat on a bench in one corner,
and we children behind her upon the
floor. By her side was an axe. She
was very pale, and her eye turned often,
first on father and then up to Heaven.
Once in a while, she looked round on
us, and especially upon little Harry, with
a long gaze, as if it might be her last,
and then a kind of shudder came over
her. I think my mother was a very
beautiful woman, for never in any dream
has anything so like an angel visited my
fancy, as my faint remembrances of my
mother in that fearful hour. Her eyes
were blue, her hair light, and her whole
appearance soft and gentle. Never did
she seem so gentle as when she looked
around on us; yet, as she gazed on the
axe at her side, and stole a glance
around upon the defences of our little
fort, her look changed, and she had the
aspect of a hero.</p>

<p>We sat for more than an hour in
breathless silence. Every ear was
stretched to catch the slightest sound,
until the effort became painful. At
last, Tiger lifted his head and uttered a
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_22">22</span>
low growl. In an instant after, he
sprang to his feet, his eye glittering
like fire, every muscle of his body being
stretched for action. My father looked
through a crevice he had left for observation.
It was a clear moonlight night,
and soon he saw four dusky figures
gliding through the edge of the adjacent
forest. He turned to mother, and said,
in a firm tone, “They are coming!” She
reached for the axe; I saw her fingers
tremble as she grasped it. Dick, with a
stout club, moved forward and stood by
my father. He was a noble fellow;
black-eyed, black-haired, and daring as
a wild-cat. His look gave tone and
courage to us all. He was stout for his
years, and as he turned round to look at
the group in the corner, there was something
in his manner which seemed to say,—“You
shall have a brave defence!”</p>

<p>There was silence for some time,
when suddenly the most fearful yell
burst upon our ears! It seemed to
come from a hundred voices, and filled
the forest with its terrific echoes. The
scream of the panther is not so terrible
as the war-cry of the savage, especially
when heard at night, and by those who
are exposed to his fury. Nearer and
nearer came the yell, and at last we
heard the enemy around our dwelling.
My father, who kept his eye steady at
the crevice, now slowly thrust the muzzle
of his gun through the hole, and taking a
deliberate aim, he fired. There was one
wild yell, a heavy fall, a brisk scampering,
and then a death-like silence. This
continued for some time, when again the
war-whoop burst from the forest, and at
least a dozen savages immediately surrounded
our dwelling. They encompassed
it with dry leaves and branches,
and set them on fire. In a few minutes
the smoke began to issue into the room,
and shortly the outside of our little cabin
was wrapped in a sheet of flame.</p>

<p>Up to this time, my remembrance of
the scene is very distinct; but what immediately
followed, I cannot clearly
recall. I have a faint recollection, or
fancy, of my father, rushing out through
the blaze, and struggling with a tall Indian
in the flames, till they both fell
exhausted and involved in the conflagration.
I have a dim remembrance of my
mother, bursting out through the falling
timbers, carrying little Harry on her
back, and leading Jane and myself
through the flames. But I was suffocated
with smoke and overwhelmed with
the terrors of the scene. From this
point my memory of that dreadful night
is a blank—save one incident alone.
Old Tiger and Dick went before my
mother, as if they were her peculiar
guard. The poor dog was dreadfully
singed, for he had already had one or
two deadly tussles with the Indians in the
flames. The long silken hair of his ears
and tail was burnt off, and the latter stuck
out straight and stiff, looking actually as
if it had been cooked. In that fearful
hour, I remember to have thought that
it had quite a ludicrous appearance.</p>

<p>The poor dog, however, had his
senses about him, and kept with my
mother and Dick, till we had proceeded
a considerable distance. We were concealed
from the view of the Indians by
a dense cloud of smoke, that rolled between
us and them. We had not gone
far, however, before we were discovered,
and two savages immediately pursued
us. Coming up with us, they fell upon
Dick, who defended himself for a time,
but receiving a blow upon the head, he
was laid prostrate on the earth. Tiger,
half dead as he was, sprang upon his
body, and stood erect for his defence.
One of the savages struck him over the
head, and, with a sad moan, the poor
creature lay dead by the side of his
master. A sickness now came over me.
I tottered, and fell unconscious to the
ground.—<span class="smaller">(<i><a href="#v6P54">To be continued.</a></i>)</span></p>

<h2>
Passage of Mountains in India.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Armies</span> sometimes find it necessary to
pass over the mountainous districts of
India. In such cases their cannon, tents,
and baggage are transported by means
of elephants. It is always a difficult,
and not unfrequently a dangerous business;
the elephants being so clumsy,
and withal so heavy, that a single
misstep might prove fatal not only to
them, but to all who accompany them.
The following is an account of the manner
in which the guns belonging to a
regiment were conveyed, by means of
elephants, over a high hill, or ghaut as it
is called.</p>

<p>Having cut a good deal of the most
prominent part of the hill away, and laid
trees on the ascent as a footing for the
elephants, these animals were made to
approach it, which the first did with
some reluctance and fear. He looked
up, shook his head, and, when forced by
his driver, roared piteously. There can
be no question, in my opinion, that this
sagacious animal was competent instinctively
to judge of the practicability of the
artificial flight of steps thus constructed;
for the moment some little alteration
had been made, he seemed willing to
approach.</p>

<p>He then commenced his examination
and scrutiny, by pressing with his trunk
the trees that had been thrown across;
and after this he put his fore leg upon
them with great caution, raising the fore
part of his body, so as to throw its weight
on them. This done, he seemed satisfied
as to their stability. The next step
for him to ascend by was a projecting
rock, which we could not remove. Here
the same sagacious examination took
place, the elephant keeping his side close
to the side of the bank, and leaning
against it. The next step was upon a
tree; but this, on the first pressure of
his trunk, he did not like. Here his
driver made use of the most tender epithets,
such as, “Wonderful, my life!”—“Well
done, my dear!”—“My dove!”—“My
son!”—“My wife!” But all
these endearing appellations, of which
elephants are so fond, would not induce
him to try again. Force was at length
resorted to, and the elephant roared
terrifically, but would not move. Something
was then removed; he seemed
satisfied, as before; and thus in time
ascended that stupendous ghaut. On his
reaching the top, his delight was visible
in a most eminent degree; he caressed
his keepers, and threw the dirt about in
a very playful manner.</p>

<p>Another elephant, a much younger
animal, was now to follow. He had
watched the ascent of the other with the
most intense interest, making motions all
the while, as though he was assisting
him by shouldering him up the acclivity;
such gestures as I have seen some
men make, when spectators of gymnastic
exercises. When he saw his comrade
up, he evinced his pleasure by giving a
salute something like the sound of a
trumpet. When called upon to take his
turn, he seemed much alarmed, and
would not act at all without force. When
he was two steps up, he slipped, but
recovered himself by digging his toes in
the earth. With the exception of this
little accident, he ascended exceedingly
well. When this elephant was near the
top, the other, who had already performed
his task, extended his trunk to
the assistance of his brother in distress,
round which the young animal entwined
his, and thus reached the summit of the
ghaut in safety.</p>

<p>Having both accomplished their task,
their greeting was as cordial as if they
had been long separated from each other,
and had just escaped from some perilous
achievement. They mutually embraced
each other, and stood face to face for a
considerable time, as if whispering congratulations.
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_24">24</span>
Their driver then made
them salam or bow to the general, who
ordered them five rupees each for sweetmeats.
On this reward of their merit
being ordered, they immediately returned
thanks by another salam.</p>

The Giraffe, or Camelopard.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> is a picture of the tallest animal
that is known. He measures almost six
yards from the ground to the top of his
ears. He is as tall as a small house.</p>

<p>The giraffe lives in the wilds of Africa;
he is never tamed and put to work
like the horse. His skin is fawn-colored,
with black spots. He is a timid creature,
and runs away as fast as he can scamper
whenever a man comes near.</p>

<p>Sometimes the lion attacks the giraffe;
his only defence in such a case is
to turn round and kick the lion as hard
as he can. Sometimes he succeeds in
defending himself in this way, but often
he falls a victim to the fierce king of
beasts.</p>

<p>The giraffe is occasionally caught
and carried to Paris and London and
this country. There have been several
in the United States; but they are tender
creatures, and are very apt to die
if taken away from their native country.</p>

The Arbor.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> are two girls and a boy in the
arbor; one of the girls is reading, and
the others are listening. It is a pleasant
thing to be beneath a roof of green
leaves, and to be surrounded by sweet-scented
flowers. It is a very pleasant
thing to sit down in such a place with
an agreeable book. Do you not envy
the children in the picture?</p>

<p>And what book do you imagine they
are reading? Perhaps it is one of the
numbers of Parley’s Cabinet Library,
which Messrs. Bradbury &amp; Soden have
just published. No doubt you have
read them; but I will tell you about one
of the volumes that is to be published
in a few days.</p>

<p>It is entitled Curiosities of Human
Nature, and it gives an account of a great
many wonderful people. It tells about
Zerah Colburn, who was a natural arithmetician.
One day, his father heard
him, while he was a little child playing
among the chips, saying the multiplication
table to himself. His father then
began to examine him, and he found that
he could answer almost any question in
arithmetic, although he was only six
years old, and could not read, and had
never been taught anything.</p>

<p>His father took Zerah to Boston and
New York, and other places, and the
child astonished everybody, by his wonderful
answers to arithmetical questions.
He could tell how many minutes there
were in two thousand years; how many
steps, three feet long, it would take to go
round the earth; he could find the square
root and the cube root of any number.
His performances were indeed amazing.</p>

<p>Mr. Colburn, finally, set off with his
son for England; here the child was
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_27">27</span>
visited by thousands of people. They
then went to France, and he excited such
an interest there, that Bonaparte had him
put into one of the colleges of Paris.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you the whole story of
Zerah, but you will find it, and many
other curious and wonderful lives, in the
number of Parley’s Cabinet Library of
which I speak. You will find the story
of a miser, who shut himself in a vault
with his money, and where, though surrounded
with silver and gold, he perished
miserably for the want of bread
and water. You will find the story of
the great Sir Isaac Newton, who, when
a child, made a little mill, and put a
kitten in it, whom he called the miller;
you will find the story of Elijah Thayer,
who went, a few months since, to see
Victoria, queen of England, and tell her
that she would very soon be obliged to
wash her own dishes.</p>

<p>Among other things in Parley’s book,
you will find the story of a very wonderful
man named Joseph Clark. This
person could twist his face about so that
his most intimate friends would not
know him. He could also distort his
body in the most strange manner. Here
is a picture of him.</p>

<div class="divcenterimg60">

<p>Clark was a pleasant, funny fellow,
and he often amused himself and others
with his queer tricks. One day he went
to a tailor to have a coat made. When
the tailor measured him he had a huge
hump on his right shoulder. When he
went to try on the coat, the hump was
on the left shoulder. The tailor was
greatly astonished—begged pardon for
his blunder, and straightway undertook
to alter the coat. When Clark went
again to try it on, behold the villanous
hump was in the middle of his
back!</p>

Fire-works at Rome.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> my little readers have heard of
the great city of Rome, in Italy. It
was begun about 2500 years ago, and a
great many wonderful events have taken
place there.</p>

<p>Rome is not so large and splendid as
it once was, but it is still a great city.
The pope, who is the head of the Catholic
church, lives there, and the ceremonies
of that church are very grand and
imposing in Rome. I could tell you a
great deal about these ceremonies, but I
have not time now.</p>

<p>I will, however, say a word of what is
called the <em>Carnival</em>. This is a time in
which the Catholics have feasts, dances
and frolics. Some of them dress up in
strange attire, and go about, making a
great deal of sport. The carnival in
Rome is really a great time. Thousands
of people, from all the countries round
about, flock to the city, where they amuse
themselves in various ways.</p>

<p>One of the most wonderful things
that takes place, is the fire-works. Perhaps
you have seen fire-works on Boston
common, but those of Rome are far
more splendid. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s Church is
suddenly illuminated, and the great castle
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Angelo sends up a vast flood
of rockets,—red, blue, purple and yellow.
The air seems filled with golden lights;
the skies appear to be showering down
stars of every hue; and while all this is
going on, the glad voices of thousands
of people are applauding the scene.

<p>Nancy left her best bonnet in the chair,
and the dog, Flirt, has got it. Here’s a
pretty kettle of fish! See how the puppy

mumbles the boquets of ribbons!</p>

she knows that Flirt is a playful

<p>This giving to the poor is called <em>charity</em>,

give a part of what we have to those
who are poor and needy. But there are
other kinds of charity, which it is our
duty to practise.</p>

<p>We should not only give money to
the poor, but we should give to all, kind

is a noble species of charity, and while it
tends to make others happy, it cultivates
sweet peace in our own bosoms. Let all
my young friends practise this species
of charity.</p>

</div>

<p class="center"><i>Jack visits the bee-hives.—Swarming.—Hiving.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day Jack was going along by a
row of bee-hives, which belonged to his
father, when he observed an unusual
confusion among the bees of one of them.
A great many bees were going in and
out at the holes of the hive, buzzing with
their wings, and seeming to be in the
greatest flurry. Besides this, the bees
had collected on the outside of the hive
in a great mass, at least an inch deep in
one place.</p>

<p>Jack had seen the bee-hives so often
that he had not thought much about
them; but now his attention was fixed.
He stopped and began to look at what
was going on, particularly among the
bees of the hive we have mentioned.
“I guess it’s Sunday,” said Jack to
himself, “among these creatures, or perhaps
it’s election day, and they are
going to choose a governor or president.
Oh—I recollect—aunt Piper told me once
that the bees were governed by a queen;
and perhaps they are now going to
choose one.”</p>

<p>Saying this, Jack sat down upon the
grass, and, hitching pretty close to the
hive, quietly contemplated the scene.
The buzzing of the bees made a roar all
around the hive, and though those which
had settled into a heap were quiet, there
were many who reminded one of the
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_31">31</span>
marshals on the 17th of June, in managing
the procession to Bunker Hill:
they were flying hither and thither—back
and forth—up and down—round
and round—in and out—appearing to be
brim full of something very important,
but really doing nothing, after all.
With them it was buzz, buzz, buzz!</p>

<p>Jack had looked quietly on for about
half an hour, when he saw an unusual
agitation in the bees that had congregated
upon the outside of the hive;
they began to flutter their little wings,
and run this way and that. All at once a
portion of them took to flight, and rising
about forty feet in the air, whirled round
and round for a few minutes, and then
streamed away upon the wind. They
were followed by others, so that a continued
line of bees was distinctly visible
in the air.</p>

<p>Jack, greatly excited, followed the runaway
bees, thinking to himself—“if you
are about to desert in this fashion, I
guess I’ll find where you are going to!”—so
he followed the stream, and, at the
distance of about fifty rods, he found that
they began to light upon an apple-tree.
Here they collected very fast, and pretty
soon he could see them gathered in a
large dark mass upon one of the limbs.
He now ran home and told his father
what was going on.</p>

<p>Jack’s father set out with another man
for the scene of action, having provided
a new hive and a brass kettle. When
they came to the apple-tree, they began
to beat the kettle, under the idea that
such kind of music is apt to induce bees,
when swarming, to settle down the more
readily. Pretty soon the whole company
had arrived and alighted upon the
limb. They were collected one upon
the other, and the whole mass looked
about as large round as a man’s arm.</p>

<p>The new hive was now placed upon a
bench beneath the tree, and some honey
was put near the holes. At evening, the
limb upon which the bees were clinging
was carefully cut down, and placed near
the hive. In the morning the bees began
to leave their place upon the bough, and
to enter the hive. In a short space they
had all taken up their abode in it, and
immediately they began to build cells, in
which to store their honey. That evening
the hive was removed and placed
upon the same platform as the other
hives. Its inhabitants seemed all pleased
with their new home, and very soon
they had stored it with honey.</p>

<p>These events made a strong impression
upon Jack’s mind, and turned his
attention to the study of bees. He
learned a great many curious things
about them, but still he was obliged to
ask his aunt Piper a multitude of questions,
in order to gratify his curiosity. I
may as well tell the substance of what
he learned about bees, in <a href="#v6P60">another chapter</a>.</p>

<h2>
The 4th of July.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> a great day is the 4th of July!
In the morning the bells are set a-ringing
and guns are fired. During the day,
the people get together, and some one
makes a great speech to them.</p>

<p>This is called independent day. Do
my readers know why the 4th of July is
thus noticed? Perhaps not—so I will
tell them.</p>

<p>A great many years ago, our country
was ruled by the king of England. The
people did not like this; they wished
to be free; to govern themselves in their
own way, and live as they pleased.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a great dispute arose between
the people of our country and the
king of England. The people said they
would not obey the king, and the king
said they should obey him. He sent
his armies over here to compel the people
to submit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_32">32</span>
All this made a great ferment in the
country. A great battle took place at
Bunker Hill, near Boston, on the 17th
of June, 1775, and hundreds were killed
on both sides. It is on account of this
battle that the monument is erected
there, the completion of which was so
beautifully celebrated on the 17th of last
June. A great many of my readers, no
doubt, saw the splendid procession, on
that occasion, consisting of the president
of the United States, and the governor of
Massachusetts, and many other distinguished
men; several thousand soldiers;
the members of a great many societies;
together with a great many other persons.
It was indeed a splendid sight.</p>

<p>Although the king of England sent
his soldiers to fight our forefathers, they
were not frightened. They mustered
armies, and sent them to fight the British
armies. They also sent some of
their wisest men to Philadelphia to consider
the state of things and determine
what was best to be done.</p>

<p>On the 4th July, 1776, these wise
men determined that it was best for the
country to be free. They therefore sent
forth a famous paper, called the <span class="smcap">Declaration
of Independence</span>. This sets forth
the wrongs which the country has suffered
at the hands of the king of England,
and declares the solemn purpose of
the American people thenceforward to
become a free, sovereign and independent
nation.</p>

<p>The people received this declaration
with joy. They celebrated it with bonfires,
and music, and processions, and
rejoicings. Ever since that day, the
4th of July, being the day in which this
declaration was passed by the congress
at Philadelphia, has been noticed as a
day of rejoicing. It is considered the
birth-day of our national independence,
and as such, it is regarded as our great
national anniversary.

Hindostan.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Hindostan</span> is a vast country in Asia,
containing almost one half as much territory
as the whole of Europe, and one
hundred and forty millions of inhabitants.</p>

<p>Yet Hindostan is governed by Great
Britain, which is almost ten thousand
miles distant—which has but twenty-four
millions of people, and a territory not
more than one tenth part as large as that
of Hindostan.</p>

<p>How is Great Britain able to govern
such a vast country—so superior in extent
and in population, and at the same
time so distant? It is done by the superior
knowledge, energy and skill of the
English people. The people of Hindostan
are ignorant and indolent; they are
content to dwell in houses made of bamboo-cane,
covered with palm leaves:
they love to sit for hours in indolent
repose, careless of the past and the future:
they are satisfied with a little rice for
food, and a tea-cup full will suffice for a
day. Such a people become an easy
prey to such busy, grasping people as the
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_34">34</span>

keep one hundred and forty millions

<h2>
Peter Somebody and the Woodpecker’s
Nest.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p class="small">The following story is sent to us by one who
affirms that he knew Peter in his boyhood—and
he assures us that this story is true, every
word of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter Somebody</span> was the companion
of my youth, and at an early period of
his boyhood commenced that series of
observations in the field of nature which
has enabled him in maturer years to tell
so many stories about the objects of nature.</p>

<p>Almost from his infancy, he delighted
in being out of doors. He loved to wander
through the fields—in the forests—through
the wild and uncultivated glen—to
climb the mountain’s top and walk
along the giddy precipice.</p>

<p>Nor were these idle rambles. In the
course of them he made himself acquainted
with birds and insects and
creeping things—whatever was rare and
singular engaged his attention, but most
of all was he pleased with those plans
which led to adventure. In his excursions
he was often attended by several
other boys, belonging to the neighborhood,
of whom he was always the leader—the
first to move forward and the
last to get tired out. It may well be
said of him, what was said of another
choice spirit:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“If e’er a pleasant mischief sprung to view,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">At once o’er hedge and ditch away he flew,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor left the game till he had run it down.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Bird-hunting and egg-gathering were
among the favorite sports of our boyhood.
Often we collected quite a quantity
of eggs, thus robbing the poor birds
of their rightful property, and a proper
place for which it had cost them much
labor to provide. I do not mention this
because I now approve of the practice,
but for the purpose, among other things,
of expressing my regret for the example
which I then set. It is considered, ofte-times,
great sport by unthinking boys,
but what is sport to them is the source
of sorrow and mourning to the harmless
beings, whose labors and hopes they thus
destroy.</p>

<p>But to my story. We were wont, as
I said, to make frequent excursions after
eggs. Those of the red-headed woodpecker
were sought for with peculiar
zeal, not only on account of their singular
beauty, but from the great number
which the nest of that bird often contains.</p>

<p>This nest is generally a hollow place
in the trunk or limb of a tree, formed by
the natural process of decay, or dug out
by the perseverance of the bird itself.
The manner in which it digs its hole is
quite worthy of notice. First, it digs
horizontally into the body of the tree for
five or six inches, and then downwards
in a sloping direction, for about a foot.</p>

<p>One day, I well recollect that Peter
and myself, with another companion,
were abroad in chase of adventure, when
suddenly a woodpecker was seen flying
round a tree, apparently in great distress.
Its hole was some distance up the tree.
The cause of its distress was unsuspected—but
Peter, ever ready for investigation,
threw down his coat and prepared
to ascertain the cause. Access to
the hole was quite difficult, and his companion,
with myself, seriously remonstrated
against the undertaking.</p>

<p>“Not so easily discouraged as all that,”
said Peter. “What would you chicken-hearts
do on the mast in a gale of wind?—come,
give us a boost, and I’ll soon see
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_35">35</span>
what is the cause of the red-headed gentleman’s
distress.” “May be,” said Seth,
(our companion, who never went by any
other name, and who was as fond of a
joke as Peter ever was,)—“may be, his
wife is sick.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Peter, “here the doctor
comes”—and with this he began his upward
progress; Seth and myself tugging
as hard to raise him as sailors
would to raise a fast anchor. I would
not intimate, however, that Peter’s climbing
powers were by any means small.
Once started, whatever difficulties lay in
the way, it was all railroad to him. He
was therefore soon up the tree, as the
saying is, and was busily occupied in
making the desired search.</p>

<p>The hole of the woodpecker is often
quite small. This, Peter well knew
from his former experience. He had
therefore stripped up his shirt-sleeve
and inserted his bare arm. Seth and
myself were at the bottom, eyeing the
operation most intently, as in such cases
is most common. All at once, Peter
uttered a wild sort of exclamation, and
for a moment we thought he would come
tumbling down.</p>

<p>“Hold on, hold on!” we both at the
same time exclaimed, “hold on!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got you,” said Peter; his countenance
indicating the grasp with which
he had clenched something—at the same
time mingled with some discomposure
of spirit.</p>

<p>“What is it?” inquired I—“what have
you got?”</p>

<p>“Is the old lady sick?” said Seth, in
his dry and caustic manner.</p>

<p>All this time, Peter was trying to extract
his hand with his clenched booty,
and severe was the rake which he gave
it, before he succeeded. But at length,
with a sort of desperation, it came, and
with it a hideous black snake! Fortunately
he had seized it in the precise
part which he could have wished—a
little below the throat. Such had been
his grasp that the mouth of the snake
was wide open, and he looked as wildly
and in as much of an agony as Sam Patch
did in his leap from the Genesee falls.</p>

<p>Peter hurled the snake to the ground,
where he soon followed. I imagine that
he looked for once somewhat pale, but
his usual flush again returned, and he
was soon ready for fresh adventure.</p>

<span class="smcap">George Washington.</span>—When George
Washington, afterwards the president of
America, was about six years of age,
some one made him a present of a hatchet,
of which being, like most children,
immoderately fond, he went about chopping
everything that came in his way;
and going into the garden, he unluckily
tried its edge on an English cherry tree,
which he barked so terribly, as to leave
little hope of its recovery.</p>

<p>The next morning, his father saw the
tree, which was a great favorite, in that
condition, and inquired who had done
this mischief, declaring he would not
have taken five guineas for the tree; but
nobody could inform him. Presently
after, George came, with the hatchet in
his hand, into the place where his father
was, who immediately suspected him to
be the culprit.</p>

<p>“George,” said the old gentleman,
“do you know who killed that beautiful
little cherry tree yonder in the garden?”
The child hesitated for a moment, and
then nobly replied, “I can’t tell a lie, pa;
you know I can’t tell a lie; I did cut it
with my hatchet.” “Run to my arms,
my boy,” exclaimed his father, “run to
my arms; glad am I, George, that you
killed my tree, for you have paid me for
it, a thousand fold. Such an act of heroism
is, my son, of more worth than a
thousand cherry trees, if blossomed with
silver, or bearing fruits of gold!”</p>

London, Past and Present.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">London</span>, the capital of the British
Empire, and by far the most splendid
city on the globe, is about two thousand
years old. It has long been the principal
city in England, but its increase has
been much greater of late years than
formerly.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the antiquity of its
origin, almost everything now existing
in London is of recent construction.
The Tower, Westminster Abbey, and a
few other edifices, are of some antiquity,
but by far the larger portion of this vast
metropolis is less than a century old.
We give a view of a portion of London,
as it was almost two hundred years ago.
Not a single edifice which appears in that
picture, is now standing; and the hills
which are visible in the distance, are
now entirely spread over with a dense
mass of buildings.</p>

<p>The increase of London, within the
last twenty years, is amazing. Hundreds
of acres are now covered with buildings,
which twenty years since were
open fields; multitudes of streets and
squares, displaying the utmost magnificence,
are now seen, which a dozen years
ago were not thought of. London now
contains nearly two millions of people;
they pay two millions of dollars a week
for labor; use forty millions of gallons
of water a day; devour two millions of
sheep, ten millions of gallons of milk,
four millions of herrings, four millions
of mackerel, and two millions of lobsters,
every year! What will London
get to be, if it goes on a century more,
increasing as it has done for the last few
years?</p>

<h2>
Whale Stories.<br>
</h2>
<h4 class="small">
<abbr title="Number One">NO. I.</abbr>—DESTRUCTION OF A VESSEL BY A
WHALE.<br>
</h4>
</div>

<p>A remarkable story is related of the
ship Essex, which belonged to Nantucket,
an island lying off the coast of
Massachusetts, long celebrated for the
enterprise of its inhabitants, in the
whale fishery.</p>

<p>This vessel, commanded by Capt.
Pollard, sailed from Nantucket in 1820,
for the Pacific Ocean. On her arrival
at the place of her destination, the crew
began to fish for whales, and for a time
went on prosperously. One day, the
seamen harpooned a young whale. In
this species of fish, the affection of the
mother for her young is very strong;
and, on this occasion, that affection was
exhibited in a striking manner.</p>

<p>Having discovered that her child—if
we may so denominate it—was killed,
she withdrew to some distance from the
ship, and then, rushing through the
water with great violence, drove furiously
against the stern of the vessel. Such
was the force of the shock, that several
of the timbers were loosened, and the
vessel pitched and reeled, as if struck by
a whirlwind.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with this exhibition of
her displeasure, she retired again, to the
distance perhaps of a mile, and then,
shooting through the waves with incredible
swiftness, came like a thunderbolt
upon the bow of the vessel. The timbers
were instantly beaten in, and the
ship began to fill with water. Scarcely
had the crew sufficient warning to throw
themselves into the boat, before she went
down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_38">38</span>
This transition, to the seamen, was as
distressing as unexpected. Just before,
they were all animation; but in a moment,
as it were, a dark prospect spread
before them. A wide, heaving and perilous
ocean lay all around them. An
open boat was their only hope, and hundreds
of miles separated them from land.</p>

<p>In such a situation, what could they
do? For some time, they momently
expected the return of their exasperated
foe; and in such an event, the “dark
unfathomed caves of ocean,” they were
sure, would be their grave.</p>

<p>But a merciful providence protected
them from the anticipated danger. They
saw no more of the wrathful monster.
But, nevertheless, they suffered much,
for many days, from boisterous weather,
but more from the want of both food and
water.</p>

<p>At length, one day, their weary eyes
caught the sight of a distant ship. They
instantly made sail towards her, and,
fortunately, were descried by her crew.
They were taken on board, where they
were kindly treated; and after other
vicissitudes, which we have no time to
relate, reached their respective homes in
safety. Surely they that go upon the
wide ocean see great wonders, and often
experience wonderful preservation!</p>

<h4 class="small">
<abbr title="Number Two">NO. II.</abbr>—DEATH OF A HARPOONER BY A
WHALE-LINE.<br>
</h4>

<p>In the year 1822, two boats, belonging
to the ship Baffin, went in pursuit of a
whale.</p>

<p>Of one of these boats, a seaman by
the name of John Carr was harpooner
and commander.</p>

<p>As they pursued the whale, it continued
to flee, until, at length, it mingled
with a vast shoal of other whales, which
they estimated at not fewer than a
hundred. Fearful of alarming them,
without being able to strike one, they
remained for a time motionless.
</p>

<p>At last, one rose not far distant from
Carr’s boat, upon which he ordered a
pull for it. At this time, the fish was
approaching them, and on passing, the
whizzing harpoon was imbedded deep
within its body.</p>

<p>In an instant following, the whale
shot nearly with the rapidity of lightning
by the boat, and in so doing jerked
the line out of its place over the stern,
and threw it upon the gunwale. This
caused the boat to dip, and nearly to fill
with water.</p>

<p>It was a moment of great peril. Carr,
who was a brave and active seaman,
seized the line, and endeavored to relieve
the boat by restoring it to its place; but,
by some circumstance, which was never
accounted for, a turn or coil of the line
flew over his arm, dragged him overboard
in an instant, and drew him under
the water, never more to rise.</p>

<p>So sudden was the accident, that only
one man, who was watching him, saw
what had happened; so that when the
boat righted, which it immediately did,
though half full of water, the whole crew,
on looking round, inquired what had
become of Carr.</p>

<p>This was a sudden and awful exit
from the world. He had not time even
for a single exclamation. The man,
who saw his removal, observed, that it
was so quick, that, though his eye was
upon him at the moment, he could scarcely
distinguish his figure, as he disappeared.
How painful to hear of such a sudden
and unexpected summons of a fellow-being
from time into eternity! How
important to be prepared for death, since,
when we least expect it, we may be
called to our final account!</p>

<p>It may be added, that when the crew
had in a measure recovered from their
consternation, they applied themselves
to restore things to order. In the mean
time, the wounded whale rose to the
surface, upon which a harpoon from the
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_39">39</span>
other boat was thrown, and several
lances were applied; but it was all in
vain.</p>

<p>The awful catastrophe, just witnessed,
so wrought upon the minds of the seamen,
that they had no spirit to follow
up the advantage which they had gained.
The whale was suffered to remain some
minutes unmolested, till, having recovered
a degree of energy, it burst away
by means of desperate efforts, and effected
its escape.</p>

<h4 class="small">
<abbr title="Number Three">NO. III.</abbr>—PERILOUS SITUATION OF A BOAT-STEERER.<br>
</h4>

<p>During a voyage of the ship Resolution,
in 1806, in pursuit of whales, in a
very high latitude, one was discovered
at some distance, upon which a boat put
off for the purpose of capturing it.</p>

<p>Before coming up with it, it dived;
but soon again making its appearance,
the crew succeeded in plunging a harpoon
into its body. The wound being
less severe than was intended, the whale
in its rage struck the boat at the stern
with its tail, and knocked the steersman
overboard.</p>

<p>As the line in a moment dragged the
boat beyond his reach, the crew flung
several of their oars towards him, for his
support, one of which he fortunately
seized. The ship and boats being at a
considerable distance from him, the harpooner
cut the line, with the view of
rescuing him from his dangerous situation.</p>

<p>But no sooner was this done, than
they discovered that they had but a single
oar remaining in the boat. The
wind was high, and with only one oar it
was impossible to reach their comrade.
Signals were made to the other boats,
but it was a long time, owing to their
distance, before they could render any
assistance, although the crew strained
every nerve.</p>

<p>At length a boat reached the now exhausted
steersman. He was stretched
out upon the oar, but was past exertion,
and almost devoid of sensation.</p>

<p>Having taken him in, they pulled for
the ship. On their arrival the poor man
was found to be in a truly pitiable condition.
His clothes were frozen like
mail, and his hair looked like a helmet
of ice. He was immediately conveyed
to the cabin, his clothes taken off, his
limbs and body dried and well rubbed,
and a cordial administered. These attentions
being paid to him, he was put
to bed. After a few hours’ sleep he
awoke, and appeared considerably restored.
But the shock which his constitution
received proved to be greater than
had been anticipated. In a short time,
he again appeared among his fellows,
and engaged in his ordinary pursuits;
but many months elapsed before he was
perfectly restored.</p>

<h4 class="small">
<abbr title="Number Four">NO. IV.</abbr>—A BOAT UPSET.<br>
</h4>

<p>In the year 1810, a vessel, called the
Aimwell, while cruising in the Greenland
seas, discovered several whales,
one of which was harpooned.</p>

<p>It is usual for a whale, on receiving a
wound, to sink; but this one dived only
for a moment, and came up directly under
the boat, which it struck with its fins
and tail, upset it, and immediately disappeared.</p>

<p>The crew, consisting of seven, were of
course tumbled into the sea; but they
contrived to get upon the bottom of the
boat. The waves being high, and the
lines rolling about, caused the boat
itself to roll so much as repeatedly to
dislodge the poor seamen, and plunge
them into the water. Four of them,
after each immersion, recovered themselves,
and clung to the boat; but the
other three, one of whom was the only
person who could swim, were drowned,
before assistance could arrive.</p>

<p>At length, the four men on the boat
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_40">40</span>
being rescued from their perilous situation,
the attack on the whale was renewed,
and two more harpoons struck.
But having been greatly irritated, and
not materially injured, the exasperated
creature put forth a surprising exhibition
of power. Its lashing of the deep was
terrible. On every side, the sea was in
a foam. In rage and agony, it burst
away, and clearing itself from the flukes
of the harpoons, it made its escape.</p>

<p>A similar story is related of a boat’s
crew belonging to the Henrietta, during
a voyage in 1812. A fish which was
struck very near the ship, by a blow of
its tail stove a small hole in the boat’s
bow. Every individual shrinking from
the side on which the blow was given,
aided the rocking of the boat, and both
together caused it to upset.</p>

<p>With great effort, however, the crew
got upon the bottom of the boat, and
could immediate assistance have been
rendered, they might all have been saved.
But the line, which was still attached to
the harpoon in the whale, became entangled
in some part of the boat, and it
was drawn under. A part of the poor
fellows went down with it, and were
seen no more. Two only arose; and,
although greatly terrified, and soon
nearly exhausted, they succeeded in
buoying themselves up, till a boat from
the ship reached them and took them in.</p>

<h4 class="small">
<abbr title="Number Five">NO. V.</abbr>—WHALING AMONG ICE.<br>
</h4>

<p>The whale fishery is sometimes carried
on in the vicinity of large fields
of ice; and when the weather is fine,
and the ships lie in a secure place, it
proves an agreeable and profitable business.</p>

<p>In these extended sheets or fields of
ice, air holes abound, at which the
whales make their appearance, and blow
or breathe. When one is observed in
this act, the men hasten across the intervening
ice, and attack it with lances,

with the intention of driving it out into
the open sea.</p>

<p>In the year 1813, the ship Esk lay by
the edge of a large sheet of ice, in which
there were several thin places, and some
holes. In one of these a whale was
seen sporting in fine style. Immediately,
a party repaired to the spot, and harpooned
it. At once, it dashed away,
and continued to run till it had dragged
out ten lines, or two thousand and four
hundred yards.</p>

<p>At length, being unable to continue
longer under water without breathing,
and yet not finding a convenient hole in
the ice, it broke through, and reared up
its head where the ice was not less than
a foot thick. Having taken breath, the
monster pushed forward, ploughing up
the ice, and rolling it up in mighty furrows
on either side, until at last it
reached a kind of basin in the field,
where it floated on the surface without
any incumbrance.</p>

<p>The harpoon was still in its back;
but it was momently expected that it
would become disengaged. What should
be done? The creature was highly exasperated,
and not materially injured.
It was dangerous to approach to it; and
yet the prize was too valuable to be lost.</p>

<p>Added to this, the party had no other
harpoon at hand. The only alternative
left them was to abandon the pursuit, or
to cut the harpoon from its back, and
imbed it still deeper.</p>

<p>This being made known to the party
by the officers, a young man stepped
forward and offered to hazard the attempt.
It was a daring experiment—a
hundred chances to one, he might fail,
and be carried by the maddened monster
under the ice. Several remonstrated,
and attempted to dissuade him from the
perilous enterprise.</p>

<p>But he would hear to no remonstrance;
and having pulled from his pocket a
large jack-knife, opened it, and passing
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_41">41</span>
round to the edge where the whale lay,
leaped upon its back, and in a few
seconds liberated the harpoon.</p>

<p>A fellow-seaman now ran to his assistance,
and likewise leaped upon its back,
held up the line, while the other, raising
the harpoon, drove it deep into its flesh.</p>

<p>Before they had finished, the monster
was under way. But, straining every
nerve, they leaped, and dashing through
the water, seized hold of the ice, and
once more obtained a firm footing.</p>

<p>Smarting under his new wound, the
whale plunged against the ice, which it
continued to break for some distance,
when, exhausted, it gave up the contest,
and sunk to the bottom of the water. It
was subsequently hauled up, and proved
to be a whale of the largest class.</p>

The Life of Columbus.<br>
</h2>

<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="One"><span class="allsmcap">I.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>
</div>

<p class="hanging"><i>Introduction—Early life—Commences a sea-faring
life—Columbus goes to Lisbon—His views about
undiscovered land in the west—He pursues
measures to go on a voyage of discovery—He
applies to the court of Spain.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Who</span> has not heard the name of
Christopher Columbus—the bold navigator,
or sailor, who first discovered
America? Yet few children in the
United States, perhaps, have read the
story of his life. It is full of interest.
Columbus was a remarkable man—remarkable
for his courage—for his enterprise—for
carrying through whatever he
attempted. Few ever made greater
exertion—few ever passed through severer
trials and dangers—few, by one
single act of their lives, were ever more
useful to the world.</p>

<p>By the children of the United States,
the name of Columbus should be had in
honor. But for his enterprise, America
would probably have remained unknown
for many years longer. Before the
voyage of Columbus, no one had crossed
the Atlantic Ocean. At the present day,
such a voyage is little more thought of
than a journey to Quebec or Niagara.
But at that time no one had ventured upon
the undertaking. No such continent
as America was known to exist, and
the uncertainty of finding land, cast so
much gloom upon a western voyage that
few were willing even to think of it.</p>

<p>But with Columbus the case was different.
He was a brave man. He was
fitted for the boldest adventures. Although
the existence of land to the west
was uncertain, Columbus had so much
faith that he determined to make the
experiment. He therefore, boldly launching
forth, stretched westward upon the
swelling waters of the Atlantic. What
was the result?—the discovery of a new
continent—of a western world—of a land
in which are now situated, among other
countries, the United States. In some
one of these states, little reader, you was
born—here you live—here you enjoy a
thousand blessings with other children—all
to be traced back, under a kind providence,
to the single voyage of Columbus
about which I am going to tell you.</p>

<p>But before I tell you of that voyage,
I will tell you some particulars of the
early life of Columbus; and when you
have read what I shall write, you will, I
think, wonder that he should have ever
undertaken it.</p>

<p>Columbus was born about the year
1435. His birth-place was Genoa, a city
of Italy. His father was a poor but
respectable man. He followed the business
of wool-combing. Columbus was
the eldest of four children. He had two
brothers and one sister.</p>

<p>When young, he was considered a
bright boy. He enjoyed few opportunities
for study, but he diligently improved
those he had. He excelled in a knowledge
of geography, of which he was
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_42">42</span>
fond. In after life his attainments in
this study were of signal use to him.</p>

<p>Having devoted as much time to study
as his father’s means would allow, he
returned home, and for a time worked at
wool-combing. But of this he was
never fond. His genius was better fitted
for more active employment, and as
soon as permitted he sought occupation
abroad.</p>

<p>The bent of his inclination was to
follow the sea. He was yet young, being
at this time but fourteen years of age, to
embark upon so dangerous a course of
life. But he had courage and resolution,
and now eagerly embraced the opportunity
of entering the service of a sea
captain by the name of Colombo, a distant
relative of his father.</p>

<p>Colombo himself was a bold, hardy,
rough seaman. In the service of such
a man, the native courage and enterprise
of Columbus were not likely to droop.
The voyages of his master were confined
to the Mediterranean sea. Sailing in
this sea, at all times dangerous by reason
of the storms which sweep across it, was
at that time doubly dangerous, since, in
addition to storms, it was thronged with
pirates.</p>

<p>With Colombo our young sailor made
several voyages, but of the particulars of
these, little is known. Some time after,
Columbus enlisted into the service of a
nephew of his old captain—a corsair, or
pirate, and a most bloody man.</p>

<p>Soon after his enlistment, his new
master received the news that four vessels,
with rich cargoes, were about sailing
from a certain port. Their great value
was quite a temptation to run some hazard
in the attempt to take them. With
this object in view, the vessels of the
corsair proceeded to sea. In a short
time the merchant vessels were discovered,
and a descent was made upon
them.</p>

<p>The vessel on board of which Columbus
was, coming up with one, began the
attack. This was boldly met. On both
sides the contest was spirited and bloody,
and lasted from morning till night.
During the engagement, these two vessels,
coming in contact, were fastened
together by means of chains and what
are called grappling irons. The parties
now fought not only with guns, but with
sabres, and with every kind of weapon
found on board. The butchery on both
sides was appalling. At length one of
the vessels took fire, and both were soon
wrapped in flames.</p>

<p>To those who survived there was now
but one way of escape—to plunge themselves
into the sea, and to reach the shore
if possible by swimming. What became
of the rest, I know not, but of Columbus
we are told that as he rose from the water
into which he had leaped, he discovered
an oar, upon which stretching himself, he
succeeded in reaching land, after swimming
a distance of six miles.</p>

<p>The next that we hear of Columbus
is at Lisbon, in Portugal, where he arrived
about the year 1470. The fight of
which I have given an account took
place at no great distance from Lisbon,
and hence it is supposed that on getting
ashore Columbus was induced to visit
Lisbon, on account of the spirit of enterprise
which more than in most other places
abounded there.</p>

<p>Not long after reaching Lisbon, he
became attached to a lady of rank, whom
he married. She was the daughter of a
distinguished sea captain, now dead.
Columbus and his wife, for a time, lived
with her mother. This lady had in her
possession many charts and journals,
belonging to her late husband. These
she presented to Columbus, and from
them he gained many new and important
ideas in relation to discoveries
which had been made, and of land which
it was thought might exist at a distance
in the oceans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_43">43</span>
Columbus now continued to follow the
seas, making several voyages to the
coast of Guinea, in Africa. But at
length he removed to the island of Porto
Santo, in the vicinity of the island of
Madeira. Porto Santo had then recently
been discovered. This island lies about
700 miles south-west from Lisbon.</p>

<p>For some years before Columbus removed
to Porto Santo, much had been
said about lands to the west. No such
lands were known to exist; but many
thought it probable that they did.</p>

<p>Columbus heard what was said, read
what was written, and his thoughts were
fixed upon the subject. After his removal,
he still dwelt upon it. At this
time, the most western lands known
were a group of islands called the
Azores. These islands lie in the Atlantic
Ocean, about half way between the
eastern and western continents. They
were discovered about the year 1450.</p>

<p>It was a question, and one of great
interest, what lay beyond the Azores, to
the west. Was it water only, or was
there land? And by taking a westerly
course could not a passage be found to
India?</p>

<p>Columbus, as I said, dwelt long upon the
subject, and at length became convinced
that there must be land. In this opinion
he was strengthened by certain discoveries
which had been made by vessels
which had sailed some distance westward
into the Atlantic Ocean. These
discoveries consisted in one case of a
piece of carved wood, and in another of
trunks of pine trees, unlike any which
grew upon the Azores—but more than
all, of two dead men’s bodies, cast upon
Flores, one of the Azore islands, after a
westerly wind, which differed in their
appearance from any race of people then
known. These, and several other circumstances,
about which I have not time
to be more particular, satisfied Columbus
that there were lands to the west of the
Azores. Thus, having formed his opinion,
his next object was to contrive some
plan to ascertain the truth of his conjectures.</p>

<p>As he was now near to the king of
Portugal, he first made application to
him. He had strong reasons to hope for
success, chiefly on account of the spirit
of enterprise which prevailed at that
time in Portugal, on the subject of discoveries.
King John listened to the
views of Columbus with interest. He
was himself nearly ready to patronize
the project, but some of his chief advisers
thought the plan a wild one.</p>

<p>King John, however, was not satisfied.
His council, therefore, advised him to get
Columbus to reveal his views and his
plans, and to keep him in doubt, while a
vessel was dispatched for the purpose of
discovering the land which Columbus
was so sure existed to the west.</p>

<p>All this was designed to rob Columbus
of the honor which he would have,
should he actually make such a discovery.
This was mean, ungenerous and
wicked. Columbus, however, knew not
the design. He frankly gave his views—disclosed
the route which he designed to
take. Like an honest man, bent on
effecting a good purpose, and trusting to
the honesty of others, he told all he
knew—all he designed.</p>

<p>The crafty Portuguese had now obtained
possession of his secret,—all they
wanted. Columbus was therefore put off
for a time.</p>

<p>In the mean while a vessel was hastily
and secretly fitted out and dispatched,
with the hope of making the discovery,
and of robbing Columbus of the glory of
the enterprise.</p>

<p>The vessel in question sailed, as I
said, but shortly after returned, her crew
being too timid to encounter the dangers
of an untried ocean.</p>

<p>Columbus at length heard of the infamous
manner in which he had been
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_44">44</span>
treated. He felt insulted—was grieved,
but his spirit remained unbroken. He
determined to quit a kingdom in which
he had been so much abused. No ties
bound him to it. His wife was now
dead. With his only son, whom she had
left to him, and whom he named Diego,
he departed for Genoa.</p>

<p>Genoa, however, was not in a favorable
situation to patronize the undertaking.</p>

<p>From Genoa he proceeded to Spain;
but in what manner, or by what route,
is now unknown.</p>

<p>The most that we know is, that one
day a stranger, humbly clad, and on foot,
leading a little boy, called at the convent
of La Rabida, not far from a seaport in
Andalusia, and requested food for the
lad. It was Columbus and Diego.</p>

<p>They were noticed by the chief man
of the convent, who entered into conversation
with Columbus, who told him the
story of his adventures. This greatly
interested the friar or chief of the convent,
who persuaded him to tarry some
time with him, and who entered with
deeper and deeper interest into the plans
of Columbus, the more they were disclosed
to him.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1486, Columbus, having
made arrangements to have Diego
educated at the convent of La Rabida,
took leave of the worthy father, and proceeded
to the court of Spain to solicit
assistance in carrying his plans into execution.</p>

<p>Ferdinand and Isabella were at this
time the sovereigns of Spain. We shall
not detain our readers with an account
of the many troubles and vexations
which Columbus experienced before his
request was granted. Several years
passed in a fruitless urgency of his
petition. Spain was at war, and her
sovereigns pretended that they could
not attend to him. Not a few distinguished
Spaniards were jealous of him,
and envious of his expected honor.
They, therefore, endeavored to dissuade
the king and queen from lending their
patronage to him.</p>

<p>But at length the time arrived when,
the war being over, the king and queen
appointed persons to arrange a plan with
Columbus. These persons, however,
pretended that he was too extravagant in
his demands, and the negotiation was
broken off. Grieved and mortified, Columbus
hastily left the court, and proceeding
towards Cordova, intended thence to
sail to France.</p>

<p>A friend to Columbus, finding he had
departed, hastily repaired to the queen,
and entreated her that he might be
recalled, and that an enterprise which
promised so much honor to Spain might
be accomplished.</p>

<p>The king would not listen to the proposal.
His funds had been exhausted
by the war, and he felt himself unable to
meet the expense. Isabella hesitated.
But at length her generous spirit was
victorious over all objections. She
offered to fit out the expedition at her
own expense, and directed that Columbus
should be recalled.</p>

<p>While this was passing, he, disappointed,
and no doubt dejected, was pursuing
his journey towards Cordova. A
messenger was dispatched to convey to
him the happy turn in his fortune. The
messenger overtook him—handed him
the recall—and shortly after Columbus
was again at Santa Fe, where the king
and queen then resided.</p>

<p>He was received with kindness both
by Ferdinand and Isabella, especially the
latter. An arrangement was soon formed
between Columbus and the queen.
By this, the former was appointed governor-general
of all lands which he
might discover. He was to be entitled
to one tenth of the gold and silver, pearls
and precious stones, which he might find.
The queen promised to fit out two
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_45">45</span>
vessels, and allowed him to furnish
one.</p>

<p>These arrangements being made much
to the satisfaction of Columbus, he set
about preparing for the voyage.</p>

<p>It was determined that he should sail
from a small sea-port by the name of
Palos. This lies exactly east from
Jamestown, in Virginia. Little did
Columbus imagine that in a little more
than one hundred years from that time, a
settlement should be begun at a spot
exactly west from where he then was,
on a continent which he should discover,
and which should be the beginning of a
noble republic, such as we see at this day
in the United States.</p>

<p>Little did he think of it. Yet he proceeded
with as much zeal in preparing
for his voyage, as if he had foreseen all
the consequences of his enterprise.</p>

<p>He now made a visit to the convent of
La Rabida, where he was welcomed by
the kind father, who expressed his joy at
the success of his friend. Here he took
up his quarters, it being at no great distance
from Palos, while the vessels
were fitting at the latter place for the
voyage.</p>

<p>I said the queen agreed to furnish two
vessels, and Columbus was permitted to
furnish one. He was unable himself to
advance the necessary funds, but a friend
kindly offered to do it for him.</p>

<p>The vessels provided for the voyage,
were such as no seaman at the present
day would think safe out of sight of
land. Only one of them had any deck.
This one, which was the largest, was
called the Santa Maria. It was commanded
by Columbus himself. The
second was called the Pinta. Her captain
was Martin Alonzo Pinzon. Nina
was the name of the third, and was commanded
by Vincente Yanez Pinzon. All
the souls on board the three amounted
to one hundred and twenty.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Lucius Valerius Pudens</span>.—Lucius
Valerius was born at Hisconium, in the
reign of Trajan. At thirteen years of
age, he became a competitor for the
prize of poetry. This prize was a beautiful
gold medal and an ivory lyre, which
was every five years adjudged to the
author who produced the best poem.
Valerius, though opposed by a number
of poets double his age, was victorious.
Among other honors paid to him, it was
determined to erect a bronze statue,
which should be placed in the most conspicuous
part of the city. The day of the
presentation of this statue to the public
view, presented a trait in the character
of Valerius, still more lovely than his
talents.</p>

<p>At the moment when the chief magistrate
was placing a crown of laurel on
the head of the statue, Valerius perceived
a young man who had contested the
prize with him,—and who was, in the
opinion of many, little inferior to him,—looking
upon this scene with a sorrowful
and dejected countenance. Valerius instantly
discovered the cause of his chagrin,
and determined to remove it, which
he did in the following manner. He
seized the laurel crown, and, pressing
towards his disappointed rival, placed it
on his head, saying, “You are more
deserving of it than I am; I obtained it
more on account of my youth than my
merit, and rather as an encouragement
than a reward.” This generous conduct
called forth enthusiastic admiration from
the spectators; and the astonished youth,
who thus unexpectedly received the
crown of victory from the hands of the
victor, was overcome with gratitude and
joy. To preserve the remembrance of
an action, which evinced at once so
much modesty and such kind feelings,
the people conferred on Valerius the
surname of <em>Pudens</em>, which signifies modest,—an
honor greater even than that
which he derived from his poetry.</p>

<h2>
Ancient Castles.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> ancient times, when war was common,
kings and chiefs used to live in
strong places, called castles. These
consisted of high stone walls, built so as
to enclose a square piece of ground in
the centre, called the court. They were,
in fact, quadrangular buildings, with a
great many rooms in them. They were
contrived so that the king or chief to
whom they belonged, might shut himself
in, with all his soldiers, and thus
defend himself from armies without.</p>

<p>The castle had always a well for water;
stables for horses, and room for their
food; it had places for soldiers; dungeons
for prisoners; and apartments for
many hundreds of people. In time of
war, all the people round about would
flock to the castle, and there they would
live, sometimes for months.</p>

<p>Castles were usually built upon lofty
pieces of ground, the access to which
was very difficult. These were generally
surrounded by deep ditches, filled with
water, across which an enemy could not
easily pass. Over this was a bridge for
the use of the people of the castle, which
was taken away whenever any fear of
an enemy was entertained.</p>

<p>Castles had towers, generally at the
four corners, and sometimes each side
of the gate. These were of a circular
form, and had loopholes, like narrow
windows, out of which the soldiers within,
shot their arrows.</p>

<p>Sometimes a castle would be besieged
for months, by armies encompassing it.
The army without would try every
means to get into the castle, or kill the
people. They would shoot their arrows
with cross-bows, and endeavor to knock
down the walls with battering-rams.</p>

<p>In travelling over Europe, the ruins
of many castles are still to be seen.
Few are met with which are in good
repair, as over all Europe the people are
now governed by laws, which afford protection,
without resorting to castles.
These are, therefore, but little used at
the present day; and even in cases
where they are still occupied, it is only
as dwellings, and not as strong-holds for
safety against enemies.</p>

<h2>
Æronautics,<br>
</h2>
<h4 class="allsmcap">OR ART OF NAVIGATING THE AIR
WITH BALLOONS.<br>
</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> this subject has little <em>practical</em>
importance, yet, in view of its interest,
especially to the young reader, we
shall devote a few pages to a notice of
some of the most splendid ærial voyages
which we find on record.</p>

<p>The fundamental principles of this art
have long been known; but the application
of them to practice is a modern
discovery. About the year 1765, Mr.
Henry Cavendish made his celebrated
discovery of the existence of inflammable
air, or, as it is called, hydrogen gas.
Common air is eight hundred times lighter
than water; hydrogen gas seven times
lighter than common air. This is the
material now used for the purpose of
filling balloons. It is obtained in several
ways; but the best methods are by applying
acids to certain metals. Iron,
zinc and sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol) are
most commonly used. The acid must
be diluted with five or six parts of water.
Iron may be expected to yield in the
common way about seventeen hundred
times its own bulk of gas, or four and a
half ounces of iron, the like weight of
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_48">48</span>
sulphuric acid, and twenty-two and a
half ounces of water, will produce one
cubic foot of hydrogen gas; six ounces
of zinc, an equal weight of acid, and
thirty ounces of water, are necessary for
producing the same quantity.</p>

<p>In the year 1782, Mr. Cavallo made
the first experiments with hydrogen gas
to raise bodies in the air. He first tried
bladders; but not succeeding, he used
China paper, in which also failing, he
was under the necessity of being satisfied
with soap-bubbles, which were the first
kind of inflammable air-balloons that
were ever made.</p>

<p>For balloons formed on a large scale,
and of rarefied air, we must direct our attention
to France, where the two brothers,
Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, paper
manufacturers at Annonay, about thirty-six
miles from Lyons, distinguished
themselves by exhibiting the first of
those ærostatic machines which have
since excited so much attention and astonishment.
The first idea of such a
machine was suggested to them by the
natural ascent of the smoke and clouds
of the atmosphere, and the first experiment
was made at Avignon, by Stephen,
towards the middle of November, 1782.
Having prepared a bag of fine silk in the
shape of a parallelpiped and in the capacity
of about forty cubic feet, he applied
to its aperture burning paper, which
rarefied the air, and caused it to ascend
rapidly.</p>

<p>Other experiments, with still greater
success, soon followed, and at length
inflammable air, or hydrogen gas, was
used, to the complete satisfaction of the
experimenters. From this time, numerous
balloons were sent up; but the first
person who made an ascension was <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr>
Pilatre de Rosier, from a garden in the
Fauxbourg <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Antoine, Paris.</p>

<p>Though several experiments on the
ascensive power of balloons had been
made in England, during the course of
the year after their discovery, the first
ærial voyage, which was undertaken by
Vincent Lunardi, an Italian, did not take
place till September, 1784. His balloon
was thirty-three feet in diameter, and
shaped like a pear. It was made of
oiled silk, with alternate stripes of blue
and red, having the car suspended from
a hoop below the balloon, by forty-five
cords.</p>

<p>In January, 1785, an ærial voyage
across the English channel, the most
adventurous that had hitherto been projected,
was made by Mr. Blanchard and
Dr. Jeffries. They left Dover castle on
the 7th of that month, at one o’clock.
The balloon for some time rising majestically
in the air, they passed over
several ships, and enjoyed a grand prospect
of the numerous objects below them.
They soon, however, found themselves
beginning to descend, and were under
the necessity of throwing out half of
their ballast, when they were about one
third of the way from Dover. When
half way across the channel, the balloon
again descended; upon which they
threw out all their ballast, and also some
books, which they had carried along
with them. At half an hour after two
they were obliged to throw away every
part of the apparatus that could possibly
be spared: but still the balloon was descending,
in spite of all their efforts.
The anchors and cords were then thrown
out; and, as the last expedient in their
power, the æronauts stripped themselves
of their own clothes. This, to their infinite
satisfaction, changed the sinking
tendency of the balloon; and reaching
the French coast, they passed over the
highlands between cape Blanc and
Calais, and landed in the forest of Guiennes.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the successful issue
of this enterprise, <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Pilatre de Rosier
and <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Romaine ascended from Boulogne,
in July, with the intention of
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_49">49</span>
crossing the English channel. To insure
the power of ascent and descent at pleasure,
they availed themselves of the combined
effect of two balloons; one filled
with inflammable air, about thirty-seven
feet in diameter, and another with rarefied
air, whose ascensive power was
about sixty pounds. The latter was
suspended below the other, at such a
distance as precluded all apprehension
of danger from the fire which was under
it. They had not, however, been long
in the air, before the spectators perceived
the balloon swelling very quickly; and
when they had attained the height of
nearly three quarters of a mile, the whole
apparatus was observed to be in flames.
This disaster was attended with fatal
consequences to the unfortunate adventurers.
They were precipitated from
their car and dashed to pieces upon the
ground.</p>

<p>The fatal accidents to which the æronaut
might sometimes be exposed, induced
philosophers to devise expedients
for diminishing the danger. So early
as the year 1783, <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> le Normand made
the experiment of leaping from the height
of a first story with a parachute, thirty
inches in diameter, in his hand; and so
much did it break the force of the fall,
that he was hardly sensible of any shock
upon reaching the ground. He thence
calculated that a parachute, fourteen feet
in diameter, attached to a man, might
protect him against all possible injury,
though falling from the regions of the
clouds. During <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Blanchard’s ascent
from Strasburg, 26th August, 1787, he
dropped a dog, connected with a parachute,
from the height of six thousand
feet. A whirlwind, however, interrupted
its descent, and bore it above the clouds.
<abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Blanchard afterwards met the parachute,
when the dog, recognising his
master, began to bark; and just as <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr>
Blanchard was going to seize it, another
whirlwind suddenly carried it beyond his
reach. Having passed vertically over
Zell, he terminated his voyage; the
parachute, still waving in the air, came
down twelve minutes afterwards. He also
sent up several small balloons, containing
parachutes to which dogs were attached,
and constructed them in such a manner
as to burst on arriving to any great height.
When the balloons were burst, the parachutes
were necessarily set at liberty,
and conveyed the animals in perfect
security to the ground. In a daring
experiment, however, which he had the
courage to make on himself, he was less
successful; for on hazarding a descent
by a parachute at Basle, he unfortunately
broke his leg.</p>

<p>On the 7th April, 1806, <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mosment,
an experienced æronaut, undertook an
ærial voyage from Lisle. He ascended
at noon, waving a flag decorated with
the imperial eagle of France, amidst the
shouts of the assembled spectators. The
commencement of his career was so
rapid, as to bear him in a very short
time beyond the vision of the crowd.
During his ascent he dropped an animal
attached to a parachute, which came
safely to the ground. About one o’clock
something was observed slowly descending
through the atmosphere, which
proved on its fall to be the flag which
<abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mosment had carried along with him.
Very soon afterwards, a murmur circulated
through the crowd, and the body
of the unfortunate æronaut was discovered
in one of the fosses of the city, lifeless,
and covered with blood. The balloon
reached the ground on the same
day, at the distance of twenty-five leagues
from Lisle; the car containing nothing
except an unloaded pistol, a little bread,
and a piece of flesh. <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Garnerin ascribes
this melancholy disaster to the
extreme shallowness of the car, and the
too great distance between the cords
which attached it to the balloon; and is
of opinion that <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mosment, when leaning
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_50">50</span>
over the car to drop the animal, had
lost his balance, and was precipitated to
the earth.</p>

<p>Of all the voyages which the history
of æronautics presents to our notice, the
<em>nocturnal</em> ærial excursions of <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Garnerin
must be ranked among the most
enterprising and adventurous. At eleven
o’clock in the evening of the 4th August,
1807, he ascended from Tivoli, at Paris,
under the Russian flag, as a token of the
peace that subsisted between France and
Russia. His balloon was illuminated
by twenty lamps; and to obviate all danger
of communication between these and
the hydrogen gas, which it might be
necessary to discharge in the course of
the voyage, the nearest of the lamps
was fourteen feet distant from the balloon,
and conductors were provided to
carry the gas away in an opposite direction.
After his ascent, rockets, which
had been let off at Tivoli, seemed to
him scarcely to rise above the earth,
and Paris, with all its lamps, appeared a
plain studded with luminous spots. In
forty minutes he found himself at an elevation
of thirteen thousand two hundred
feet, when, in consequence of the dilation
of the balloon, he was under the necessity
of discharging part of the inflammable
air. About twelve o’clock, when
three thousand six hundred feet from the
earth, he heard the barking of dogs;
about two, he saw several meteors flying
around him, but none of them so near as
to create apprehension. At half past
three he beheld the sun emerging in
brilliant majesty above an ocean of
clouds, and the air being therefore expanded,
the balloon soon rose fifteen
thousand feet above the earth, where he
felt the cold exceedingly intense. In
seven hours and a half from his departure,
<abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Garnerin descended near Loges,
forty-five leagues distant from Paris.</p>

<p>The same intrepid æronaut undertook
a second nocturnal voyage, on the 21st of
September, 1807, in the course of which
he was exposed to the most imminent
danger. <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Garnerin, prognosticating
an approaching storm, from the state of
the atmosphere, refused to be accompanied
by <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> de Chassenton, who earnestly
requested it. He ascended therefore
alone from Tivoli, at ten o’clock, and
was carried up with unexampled rapidity
to an immense height above the clouds.</p>

<p>The balloon was then dilated to an
alarming degree, and <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Garnerin, having
been prevented by the turbulence of
the mob, before his ascent, from regulating
those parts of his apparatus which
were meant to conduct the gas away
from the lamps on its escape, was totally
incapable of managing his balloon. He
had no alternative left, therefore, but
with one hand to make an opening two
feet in diameter, through which the inflammable
air was discharged in great
quantities; and, with the other, to extinguish
as many of the lamps as he
could possibly reach. The æronaut was
now without a regulating valve, and
the balloon, subject to every caprice of
the whirlwind, was tossed about from
current to current. When the storm
impelled him downwards, he was forced
to throw out his ballast, to restore the
ascending tendency; and at last, every
resource being exhausted, no expedient
was left him to provide against future
exigencies. In this forlorn condition,
the balloon rose through thick clouds,
and afterwards sunk; and the car, having
struck against the ground, with a
violent impulse rebounded from it to a
considerable altitude. The fury of the
storm dashed him against the mountains,
and, after many rude agitations and
severe shocks, he was reduced to a state
of temporary insensibility. On recovering
from his perilous situation he reached
Mont Tonnerre, in a storm of thunder.
A very short time after his anchor
hooked in a tree; and, in seven hours
and a half, after a voyage which had
nearly proved fatal to him, he landed at
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_51">51</span>
the distance of three hundred miles from
Paris.</p>

<p>The advantages hitherto derived from
ærial navigation have by no means
proved adequate to the expectations excited
by the novelty and promising aspect
of the science. This failure, in their
utility, may in a great degree be ascribed
to the art of steering balloons
being yet undiscovered. And we may
here add, that no probability exists that
the art will ever be attained.</p>

<p>The French, indeed, once instituted
an academy for the purpose of improving
the state of æronautics, and a corps of
fifty young men were selected, and for a
time trained to the service. A balloon
thirty-two feet in diameter was provided,
and in favorable weather was often sent
up to the distance of from one hundred
and sixty to two hundred and forty yards,
with some of the young æronauts in it.
The institution, however, is now abandoned.</p>

<p>Balloons are uniformly constructed of
silk lustring. From the price of this
article, the expense of only a moderate
sized balloon is great. A balloon of
only twelve feet in diameter will require
fifty square yards; a balloon thirty feet
in diameter requires three hundred and
fourteen yards of cloth, and when filled
its ascensive power will be five hundred
and eighty-one pounds.</p>

<p>A parachute, which is much like an
umbrella, is sometimes employed to descend
from a balloon in case of accident.
The parachute by which <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Garnerin
descended from Paris, in 1797, was
twenty-five feet in diameter, and was
made of cloth; and that by which he
descended in London, in 1802, is said
to have been a large umbrella, consisting
of thirty-two gores of canvass, twenty-three
feet in diameter, and without ribs
and handle. At the top there was a
round piece of wood, ten inches in diameter,
having a hole in the centre, which
was fastened to the canvass by thirty-two
short pieces of tape. About four feet
and a half from the top of the canvass, a
wooden hoop, eight feet wide, was put
on and tied by a string from each seam.
Several ropes, about thirty feet long, proceeding
from the edge of the parachute,
terminated in a common joining. From
this point there issued shorter ropes, to
whose extremities was fastened a circular
basket, in which <abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Garnerin himself
was stationed. The parachute and basket
were immediately disunited from
the balloon, by the cutting of a cord
which communicated with the net-work,
and in falling downwards, the parachute
naturally expanded, by the resistance of
the air.</p>

Eccentric Characters.<br>

<p>We propose to give to our readers a few
chapters upon eccentric characters. We cannot
better begin than with the</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the singular personages who
have occasionally attracted public notice
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_52">52</span>
in London, the individual just mentioned
is not the least remarkable. He
was a native of Prussia, and bore a military
commission in the service of that
country; but a quarrel with a brother
officer resulted in a duel, in which he
wounded his antagonist. Uncertain of
the result, he sought refuge in England,
and conceiving a partiality for the country,
he resolved to pass the remainder of
his days there.</p>

<p>The singularity of his dress and character
soon drew the attention of the curious.
He affected literature, and wrote
poetry, which he used to recite to his
friends. Of this, we have only been
able to discover the following couplet,
which evinces no small stock of that
comfortable commodity, self-complacency.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“In all the world but heroes two I know,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Prussia’s famed king, and Chevalier Dessessau.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He was well acquainted with Burke,
Johnson, Murphy, Goldsmith, and most
of their contemporaries, eminent for genius
and talent in the walks of literature
and the drama. These persons seemed
to find great amusement in the quaint
humors and amiable eccentricity of this
singular personage. The preceding
sketch gives an idea of the dress in
which he appeared abroad. His clothes
were black, and their fashion had all the
stiff formality of those of an ancient
buck. In his hand, he carried a gold-headed
cane, a roll of his poetry, and a
sword.</p>

<p>Toward the latter part of his life, the
count was reduced by misfortunes to a
residence within the walls of the Fleet
prison. Yet such was the confidence
placed in his honor, that he was permitted
to go where he pleased. He died in
1775, aged seventy, having bequeathed
a “curious sword, a gold medal, and a
curious picture, to a great personage”—probably
the king of Prussia.

 <p class="caption allsmcap">JOHN BIGG, THE DINTON HERMIT.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> strange man lived in England,
about one hundred and twenty years ago.
He was a person of some wealth and
learning, and was clerk to Simon Mayne,
one of the judges who passed sentence
of death on Charles I. After Charles
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> was restored, he grew melancholy,
perhaps on account of the turn public
affairs had taken, and retiring to a cave
in Dinton, he spent the remainder of his
life there, as a hermit.</p>

<p>He was often visited, and lived upon
charity. It is curious that he never
asked for anything but leather. When
a piece was given to him, he would nail
it to his clothes. Thus he became, at
length, thatched over with pieces of
leather. He kept three bottles hung to
his girdle—one for strong beer, one for
small beer, and one for milk.</p>

<p>He was regarded as a great curiosity
in his time. His shoes were preserved
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_53">53</span>
so late as 1712; they were enormous,
consisting of near a thousand small bits
of leather, each. After his death, the
cave was dug over, in the expectation of
finding money, or some relics of the hermit,
but without success. He died in
1696.</p>

A lost Elephant found.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A female</span> elephant belonging to a
gentleman at Calcutta, being ordered
from the upper country to Chotygore,
broke loose from the keeper, and was
lost in the woods. The excuses which
the keeper made were not admitted. It
was supposed that he had sold the elephant;
his wife and family, therefore,
were sold for slaves, and he was himself
condemned to work upon the roads.
About twelve years after, this man was
ordered into the country to assist in
catching wild elephants. The keeper
fancied he saw his long-lost elephant, in
a group that was before him. He was
determined to go up to it; nor could the
strongest representations of the danger
dissuade him from his purpose. When
he approached the creature, she knew
him, and giving him three salutes, by
waving her trunk in the air, knelt down
and received him on her back. She
afterwards assisted in securing the other
elephants, and likewise brought with her
three young ones, which she had produced
during her absence. The keeper
recovered his character; and, as a recompense
for his sufferings and intrepidity,
had an annuity settled on him for
life. This elephant was afterwards in
the possession of Governor Hastings.</p>

<span class="smcap">Anna Maria Schurman.</span>—Anna Maria
Schurman was born in the year
1607. Her extraordinary genius discovered
itself at six years of age, when she
cut all sorts of figures in paper with her
scissors, without a pattern. At eight,
she learned to draw flowers in a few
days, in a very agreeable manner. At
ten, she took but three hours to learn
embroidery. She was afterwards taught
music, vocal and instrumental, painting,
sculpture and engraving, in all of which
she succeeded admirably.</p>

<p>She excelled in miniature painting,
and in cutting portraits upon glass with
a diamond. Hebrew, Greek and Latin
were so familiar to her that the most
learned men were astonished at it. She
spoke French, Italian and English, fluently.
Her hand-writing in almost all
languages was so beautiful, that the curious
preserved specimens of it in their
cabinets.</p>

<span class="smcap">An Indian Youth.</span>—A native gentleman
of India, in relating his history to
one of the missionaries, said:</p>

<p>“My father was an officiating priest of
a heathen temple, and was considered in
those days a superior English scholar;
and by teaching the English language
to wealthy natives, realized a very large
fortune. At a very early period, when
a mere boy, I was employed by my
father to light the lamps in the pagoda,
and attend to the various things connected
with the idols. I hardly remember
the time when my mind was not exercised
on the folly of idolatry. These
things, I thought, were made by the hand
of man, can move only by man, and
whether treated well or ill, are unconscious
of either. Why all this cleaning,
anointing, illuminating, &amp;c.?</p>

<p>“One evening, these considerations so
powerfully wrought on my youthful
mind, that, instead of placing the idols
according to custom, I threw them from
their pedestals, and left them with their
faces in the dust. My father, seeing
what I had done, chastised me so severely,
as to leave me almost dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_54">54</span>
“When I recovered, I reasoned with
him, that, if they could not get up out of
the dust, they were not able to do what
I could; and that, instead of being worshipped
as gods, they deserved to be
down in the dust, where I had thrown
them. My father was implacable, and
said he would disinherit me, and, as the
first step to it, sent me away from his
house. He relented, however, on his
death-bed, and left me all his wealth.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>I am carried to an Indian village.—The scene described.—Am
insulted by the young Indians.—They
get well punished.—Painful thoughts.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I do</span> not know how long it was after
the scene I have described, when I so
far recovered my senses as to notice the
objects around me. When my consciousness
returned, I was lying on the ground,
and no one appeared to be near me. I
attempted to rise, and nearly got upon
my feet, when I became giddy, and was
obliged to sit down. I was distressed
with a pain in the head and a burning
thirst.</p>

<p>I now saw at a little distance a group
of Indians, and about the same time one
of them noticed me. He spoke and
pointed to me, upon which an Indian
woman and two children ran towards
me. I held out my hands and begged
them to have pity on me. The woman
spoke to me, but I could not understand
her. The children, who were Indians,
and fierce-looking creatures, stood at a
little distance for a time, as if afraid of
me. Pretty soon they came nearer, and,
in order to discover what kind of a creature
I might be, one of them took a stick
and gave me a pretty sharp poke in my
back.</p>

<p>I writhed and groaned, for it hurt me;
but this only made the young Indians
laugh. The woman scolded them, however,
and as the youngsters gave me
another poke, she flew toward them, and
aimed a blow with her hand at the head
of the aggressor. It missed, however,
and the two imps ran laughing to a
distance. There, in safety, they stood
gibbering and jeering, like two monkeys,
till the woman, in a rage, set out after
them; but diving into a thicket, the
young rogues easily escaped and disappeared.</p>

<p>The woman now helped me upon my
legs, and took me to a tent, around which
were several Indians, mostly women and
children. I noticed, also, several other
tents, and knew that I was in an Indian
village, or encampment. How I had
been brought hither, I did not know, nor
did I ever afterwards ascertain. It is
probable, however, that it was by the
care of the Indian woman, in whose
charge I now was. She took me into a
tent, and procured me some water. This
refreshed me greatly, and I was soon
able to take notice of the things around
me.</p>

<p>The tent was made of dried deerskins,
and was supported by poles about
twelve feet long. The whole tent was
about fourteen feet across. There were
in it, a few skins of bears and buffaloes,
a bow and some arrows, two or three
gourd-shells, a small brass kettle, a buffalo’s
pate with the horns attached, a
bunch of long, crooked bear’s claws, and
a bundle of human scalps. These were
all the articles I noticed.</p>

<p>After a while I felt very sleepy, and
lying down, I had a long nap. When I
awoke, I felt nearly well, and went to
look out of the tent. There were, at
least, fifty tents around, occupying a
space of several acres, upon the edge of
a small prairie, bordered by forests.
The scene was quite lively; for two or
three hundred Indians were before me,
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_55">55</span>
nearly all, however, being women, children,
and old men. I was afraid to go
forth, and was about to creep back into the
tent, when the woman before mentioned
came, and taking me by the arm, led me
out.</p>

<p>I was very soon surrounded by a host
of people, and such a chattering I never
heard before. A ring was formed around
me, and every one seemed to have something
to say. If I had been a new monster
under the sun, there could not have
been more wonder expressed. I imagine
that they treated me very much as
a parcel of Boston boys would treat a
young alligator, should they happen to
catch one. I looked in the faces of
many of these persons, but I saw not
one look of kindness. At last a boy
about my own age, who had a small
bow in his hand, shot an arrow at me,
which, being pointed with a bit of sharp
iron, entered the flesh of my arm. A
moment after, two or three of the little
savages set upon me, and began to tear
off my clothes. They pulled me hither
and thither, and in a short space I was
entirely naked.</p>

<p>For a time, I made no resistance, for
I had an idea that natural pity would
teach even these creatures to spare one
so helpless as myself. But finding that
they had no pity, my anger began to
rise; and when the boy who had shot
his arrow into my arm, came up and
began to pinch me, I struck him by the
side of his head, and he went reeling and
tumbling, like a smitten nine-pin, upon
the ground. This caused a loud laugh,
and I saw that a feeling of interest and
respect was instantly created in my behalf
by my resistance. This taught me
a lesson, and instead of waiting for Indian
pity and sympathy, I determined to
obtain the regard of my captors by my
spirit. When, therefore, the little imps
set upon me again, as they soon did, they
paid dearly for it. I was very strong
and active for my age, and when, at last,
an Indian lad, much larger than myself,
came softly behind me, and gave my
hair a twitch, I turned to punish him.
The fellow fled and I pursued. The
ring opened to give him space, and he
struck into the little plain encircled by
the tents. I hung close at his heels. It
was a tight race, and such yells broke
from the congregation of Indians as I
had never imagined. The fellow went
nearly across the plain, and, dodging this
way and that, sought to throw me off.
At length he passed round one of the
tents, and returned toward the point from
which we started. I followed, and finally,
just as he reached the ring, I seized his
hair, and gave it a jerk which made him
yell like a catamount. This completely
sealed my triumph. The looks of contempt
around, were exchanged for those
of admiration, and I was borne back to my
tent with shouts of praise and exultation.</p>

<p>It was but a few weeks before I was
at home among the Indians. I was
adopted as the son of the woman who
had taken care of me, in the place of
one she had lost. By degrees I became
accustomed to Indian sports and pastimes,
and gradually learned their language.
I was generally well treated
after the fashion of savage life. There
is little family government among these
people; everything between the children
is settled by strength; those principles
of kindness, justice, pity and tenderness
for the weak, which are so strongly
inculcated among civilized people, being
unknown to them. Matters are regulated
very much as between animals—a
herd of bisons for instance, or a pack
of wolves. I had, therefore, to fight
my way, and being very strong, I not
only fared pretty well, but I obtained
no little applause. At first, I was taunted
and sneered at for being <em>white</em>, but I
always punished such impudence, and
at last these gibes ceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_56">56</span>
I often thought of my father and mother,
my sister and brother, and longed
to know their fate—for I was uncertain
whether they had escaped or had perished
on that fearful night in which our
house had been reduced to ashes. Of
these things, however, I could obtain no
information. I knew too little of the
Indian tongue to ask these questions,
which often arose in my own mind.
Sometimes, and especially at night, the
thoughts of home and my kindred stole
over me, and the tears would come into
my eyes; but in the morning these painful
thoughts would subside, and perhaps
be forgotten in the pursuit of present
objects.</p>

<span class="smcap">Shenstone and the Robber.</span>—Shenstone,
a well-known English poet, was
one day walking through a wooded retreat
with a lady, when a man rushed
out of a thicket, and, presenting a pistol
at his breast, demanded his money.
Shenstone was surprised, and the lady
fainted. “Money,” said the robber, “is
not worth struggling for; you cannot be
poorer than I am.” “Unhappy man,”
exclaimed Shenstone, throwing his purse
to him, “take it, and fly as quickly as
possible.” The man did so—threw his
pistol in the water, and instantly disappeared.
Shenstone ordered his servant
to follow the robber and observe where
he went.</p>

<p>In two hours, the man returned, and
informed his master that he followed the
robber to the house where he lived; that
he went to the door, and peeping through
the key-hole, saw the man throw the
purse on the ground, and say to his wife,
“Take the dear-bought price of my honesty;”
then taking two of his children,
one on each knee, he said to them, “I
have ruined my soul to keep you from
starving,” and immediately burst into a
flood of tears. Shenstone, on hearing
this, lost no time in inquiring the man’s
character, and found that he was a laborer,
oppressed by want and a numerous
family, but had the reputation of
being honest and industrious. Shenstone
went to his house,—the poor man
fell at his feet and implored mercy. The
poet took him home with him and provided
him with employment.</p>

<span class="smcap">George <abbr title="Four"><span class="smcap">IV.</span></abbr> and Lord Roden.</span>—When
George <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> was in Ireland, he
told Lord Roden that on a particular
morning, he was coming to breakfast
with him. He accordingly set out, and
taking two or three of the nobility with
him, he happened to arrive just as his
lordship and family had assembled for
family worship. Lord Roden, being
told that his guest had arrived, went to
the door, met him with every expression
of respect, and seated him and the gentlemen
that accompanied him in the parlor.
He then turned to the king and
said, “Your Majesty will not doubt that
I feel highly honored by this visit, but
there is a duty, that I have not discharged
this morning, which I owe to the King
of kings—that of performing domestic
worship, and your majesty will be kind
enough to excuse me, while I retire with
my household and attend to it.” “Certainly,”
replied the king; “but I am
going with you,” and immediately rose
and followed him into the hall where
his family were assembled, and taking
his station in an old arm-chair, remained
during the family devotions.</p>

<p>This anecdote reflects honor both upon
his lordship and his majesty; while it
exhibits in the one the dignity of unyielding
Christian principles, it displays
in the other the courtesy of a gentleman,
and the regard felt for a consistent religious
character.</p>

The Old Oaken Bucket.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> Yankee, brought up in the country,
does not remember the old oaken
bucket? It is the fashion now, in New
England, to draw the water from the
well by means of a windlass; but twenty
or thirty years ago, it was the custom
to draw it up with a long pole, set across
an upright beam. To one end of this
pole, swung a rope or long stick, and
the bucket was attached to this.</p>

<p>There is a beautiful song, about the
old oaken bucket, written by Mr. Samuel
Woodworth, a native of Scituate, in
Massachusetts. It is very well known,
and many of my readers have no doubt
seen it, but I wish them all to learn it
by heart.</p>

<p>Such pretty songs as this, not only
give a great deal of innocent pleasure,
but they are useful, in a high degree.
They make us more fond of that place
which we call home; they serve to
attach us to our country; they serve to
make us content with the simplicity of
early times and of country life. If we
think how many thousand times this
song has been sung; what an immense
amount of enjoyment it has given, and
how much real good it has done, we
shall see that there is great reason why
we should all remember Samuel Woodworth
with pleasure and respect.</p>

France.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a country in Europe, called
France. It lies east of the United
States, and you must cross the Atlantic
Ocean to get there. There are almost
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_59">59</span>
forty millions of people in France, and
they have many splendid towns and
cities. Paris is the capital of the country,
and a charming city it is. It has
as many inhabitants as the whole state
of Massachusetts, and they have a thousand
ways of amusing themselves.</p>

<p>The people who live in the country
and labor on the lands, called peasants,
are generally poor, and work very hard.
If you ever travel in France, you will
often see old women at work in the
fields, carrying burthens of sticks, grass
or hay. You will see them hoeing,
digging, ploughing and harvesting.</p>

<p>A peasant woman in France gets but
about three or four cents a day for her
labor, and with this she can buy but few
things to live upon. She usually goes
barefoot, or wears heavy wooden shoes.
She seldom eats meat, and often has no
other breakfast than a glass of water and
a few cherries, or grapes, or perhaps an
apple. This is indeed poor fare.</p>

<p>In travelling in France, you will often
see women in the fields taking care of
the cows, and I have seen a woman spend
the whole day in attending a single
cow, which was grazing along the road-side.
But while the woman watched
the cow, she spun a little twine out of
flax, by means of a stick, which she kept
twirling between her fingers.</p>

<p>There are few countries in which the
people, at large, are so happy as in our
own country. The rich people fare very
well in all countries, but the poor people
are not happy in England, or France, or
Germany, or any other country than
ours. Should we not be thankful that
a good Providence has cast our lot in

The Moose.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> is a picture of a moose, a huge
animal of the deer kind, which is found
in the state of Maine, and in Canada.
It is sometimes six and even seven feet
high, to the top of his shoulders; and
the points of his immense horns, when
he holds up his head, are ten feet from
the ground.</p>

<p>There is something very queer about
the appearance of the moose. His body
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_60">60</span>
is short, his legs are long, his neck is
thick, his countenance is dull, his mouth
is large, his nostrils wide. His whole
aspect is stupid—and yet he wears upon
his head a pair of spreading horns or
antlers, of the most fantastic shape.
They are branched like some kinds of
seaweed, or like coral, that grows in the
bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>It really seems, at first sight, as if
nature intended a joke, when she contrived
the moose—for he reminds us of
a very stupid-looking person, bedizzened
with an enormous head-dress. But we
must not go too much by looks—for the
moose, however he may appear as we
see him in the picture, is a very fleet
animal, and if you see him in his native
woods, with the Indians or the hounds
at his heels, he will show you that he is
a pretty smart fellow, after all.</p>

<p>The moose sheds his horns every year,
and it is not uncommon to find them in
the woods of Maine. Sometimes the
creature gets his horns so entangled in
the branches of the trees, that he cannot
get away, and he then dies, or is caught
by the hunters.</p>

<p>The Indians of Maine hunt the moose
in winter: when the snow is deep, he
cannot travel very fast, for his feet sink
in the snow, and he is soon run down.
The flesh of the moose is often brought
to the Boston market.</p>

<p>There is an animal in the north of
Europe, called the Elk, which is very
like the moose, but it is believed, by
learned men, not to be exactly the same
kind of creature.</p>

<i>About the Bees.</i><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the preceding chapter we have told
how Jack became interested about the
bees: in this, we have promised to relate
some of those curious things which his
aunt Piper told him,—respecting the
manners and customs of these ingenious
and wonderful insects.</p>

<p>The bees, being domesticated by mankind,
have been carefully studied by
many learned and curious persons; but
<abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Huber, a Swiss gentleman, has done
more than any other man to make us
acquainted with them. And yet Huber
was blind! His wife assisted him in his
observations; and thus, by making use
of her eyes, he was able to pursue his
studies with great success. Is it not
interesting to think of this blind philosopher,
who, while all was darkness and
night to him, was yet able to amuse himself,
and prepare a book which should
continue long to please and enlighten
mankind?</p>

<p>There are three different kinds of bees
in every hive. First, the laboring bees,
which make up the far greatest number,
and are thought to be neither male nor
female, but merely born for the purposes
of labor and continuing the breed by
supplying the young with provision
while yet in their helpless state.</p>

<p>The second sort are the drones; they
are of a darker color, longer, and more
thick by one third than the former; they
are supposed to be the males; and there
are not above a hundred of them in a hive
of seven or eight thousand bees. The
third sort is much larger than either
of the former, and there is never but one
permitted to live in a swarm. These
are called queen bees, and lay all the
eggs from which the whole swarm is
hatched in a season.</p>

<p>In examining the structure of the
common working bee, the first thing
that attracts our attention is the trunk
which serves to extract the honey from
flowers. It is not formed like that of
other flies, in the form of a tube by which
the honey is to be sucked up; but like
a broom to sweep, or a tongue to lick it
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_61">61</span>
away. The animal is furnished also
with teeth, which serve it in making wax.
This substance is gathered from flowers,
like honey; it consists of that dust or
farina, which contributes to the fruitfulness
of plants, and is moulded into wax
by the little animal at leisure.</p>

<p>Every bee, when it leaves the hive to
collect its precious store, enters into the
cups of the flower, particularly such as
seem charged with the greatest quantities
of this yellow farina. As the animal’s
body is covered with hair, it rolls
itself within the flower, and soon becomes
quite covered with the dust, which it
soon after brushes off with its two hind
legs, and kneads into two little balls.</p>

<p>In the thighs of the hind legs there
are two cavities, edged with hair, and into
these, as into a basket, the animal sticks
the rolls or pellets which it has collected.
Thus employed, the bee flies from flower
to flower, increasing its store and adding
to its stock of wax, until the ball upon
the thigh becomes as big as a grain of
pepper; by this time, having got a sufficient
load, it returns, making the best of
its way to the hive.</p>

<p>The lower part of the body or belly
of the bee is divided into six rings, which
sometimes shorten the body by slipping
one over the other. It contains within
it, besides the intestines, the honey-bag,
the venom-bag, and the sting. The
honey-bag is as transparent as crystal,
containing the honey that the bee has
brushed from the flowers; of which the
greater part is carried to the hive, and
poured into the cells of the honey-comb,
while the remainder serves for the bee’s
own nourishment; for, during the summer,
it never touches what has been laid
up for winter.</p>

<p>The sting, which serves to defend this
little animal from its enemies, is composed
of three parts; the sheath, and
two darts which are extremely small and
penetrating. Both the darts have several
small points or barbs, like those of a
fish-hook, which render the sting more
painful, and make the darts rankle in the
wound. Still, however, this instrument
would be a very slight defence, did not
the bee poison the wound. The sheath,
which has a sharp point, makes the first
impression, which is followed by that of
the darts, and then the venomous liquor
is poured in.</p>

<p>The sheath, with the barbs, sometimes
sticks so fast in the wound, that the animal
is obliged to leave it behind; in consequence
of which, the bee soon after
dies, and the wound is considerably
inflamed. It might at first appear well
for mankind, if the bee were without its
sting; but upon recollection it will be
found that the little animal would then
have too many rivals in sharing its
labors. A hundred other lazy animals,
fond of honey, and hating labor, would
intrude upon the sweets of the hive;
and the treasure would be carried off for
want of armed guardians to protect it.
As the bee lays up a most delicious
store, it was obviously necessary that it
should have some extraordinary defence,
and so the sting was provided. Is it not
easy to see wisdom in this provision of
nature?</p>

<p>The most interesting point of view in
which we can regard bees, is not as
separate individuals, but as societies or
communities. In this light, they indeed
astonish us. It being necessary that
their hives should be tight, the first thing
is to stop up all the crevices, which they
do with a kind of resinous gum, which
resists the weather.</p>

<p>They then proceed to form their cells,
which we call honey-comb. These are
built in hexagons, or six-sided figures;
and mathematicians tell us that this
form is the very best, as it unites the
greatest strength with the greatest capacity.
The philosophers found out this
fact by deep study—but who told the
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_62">62</span>
little bees of it? They never went to
college to learn mathematics. How
then should they always build their cells
in hexagons?</p>

<p>This was one of the questions put by
Jack to his aunt Piper, and she answered
it as follows. Bees are provided with
wonderful knowledge, which we call
instinct. It is born with them, and as
soon as they go to work, they proceed
according to this instinct. This is a
part of their nature, and it is given to
them by God who made them. He
knows everything—he knows that a
hexagon is the best form for the bees to
build their cells in, and so he furnished
them with an instinct, which leads them
to follow this method of building. Is it
not interesting to see the Almighty God
thus displaying his knowledge and skill,
for the benefit of even the little bees?</p>

<p>I have more to tell you on this subject,
but I must defer it for <a href="#v6P94">another chapter</a>.

<h2 class="no-break">
The Race.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> are two boys running a race.
They seem to be striving to see which
can run the swiftest; which can outstrip
the other.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to run a race, if one is
young and has a good pair of legs. I
should make a bad business of it,—old
and decrepit as I am,—and having a
timber toe beside. Still, I can well recollect
how I used to delight in trying
my speed with my youthful companions,
when I was a boy.</p>

<p>I remember very well, that, when I
was young, there was a boy at school
by the name of Rufus, and it chanced
that he and myself were rivals in almost
everything. We were always striving
to see which should run the swiftest;
which should hop the farthest; which
should excel in writing, arithmetic,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Now all this was very well, except
one thing. Our rivalry at last went so
far, that we desired victory more than
anything else. We did not wish so
much to do things well, as to triumph
over our competitors. Nor was this all:
we began at length to dislike each other,
and a very bad feeling was therefore
begotten by our strife, in our bosoms.</p>

<p>This was certainly wrong, and young
people as well as old people should be
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_63">63</span>
careful never to indulge in any strife
which leads to hatred. We should love
all around us, for love is the chief source
of happiness. Anything which interferes
with this is wrong.</p>

The Swing.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> are children indulging themselves
in swinging. ’Tis a very pleasant
amusement, and is as near to flying
as anything we can do. What a thrill
passes through the heart, half pleasant
and half painful, when we go up, up,
up—and then down, down, down!</p>

<p>In the western country, the children
do not have to make swings of ropes, for
they are provided by nature. The grape
vines climb up the trees, often to the
height of twenty feet, and then afford
good swings for the children. If you
ever visit Kentucky, or Ohio, or Missouri,
or any of those great states in
the west, you will probably see children
amusing themselves in grape vine
swings.

<h2>
A Strange Bird.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> long since, a man in Connecticut
shot an eagle of the largest kind. The
creature fell to the ground, and being
only wounded, the man carried him
home, alive.</p>

<p>He now gave him to another man,
who took good care of the wounded bird,
and pretty soon he got quite well. The
eagle became attached to the place where
he was thus taken care of, and though
he was permitted to go at large, and
often flew away to a considerable distance,
he would always come back again.</p>

<p>He used to take his station in the
door-yard, in front of the house: if any
well-dressed person came through this
yard, to the house, the eagle would sit
still and make no objections; but if a
ragged person came into the yard, he
would fly at him, seize his clothes with
one claw, and hold on to the grass with
the other, and thus make him a prisoner.</p>

<p>Often was the proprietor of the house
called upon to release persons that had
been thus seized by the eagle. It is a
curious fact that the bird never attacked
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_64">64</span>
ragged people going to the house the
back way: it was only when they attempted
to enter through the front door,
that he assailed them. What renders
this story very curious is, that the bird
had never been trained to act in this
manner.</p>

<p>This eagle had some other curious
habits. He did not go out every day to
get a breakfast, dinner and supper: his
custom was, about once a week, to make
a hearty meal, and that was sufficient
for six days. His most common food
was the king-bird, of which he would
sometimes catch ten in the course of a
few hours—and these would suffice for
his weekly repast.</p>

<p>This bird at last made such havoc
with the poultry of the neighbors, that
the proprietor was obliged to kill him.</p>

<p>It seems that the aversion of this eagle
to ragged people, was not altogether singular;
for a person who writes to the
editor of the New York American, says
that he once knew a Baltimore Oriole,
that would always manifest the greatest
anger if a shabby person came into the
room. This bird also disliked colored
people, and if he could get at them, he
would fly in their faces, and peck at
them very spitefully—while he did no
such thing to white people.</p>

<p>
<a id="v6P64"></a>The following letter has been some time in hand.
Will our little friend, the writer, forgive us for not
inserting it sooner? Our correspondents must remember
that we have many things to attend to, and
if some of their favors seem to be overlooked, we
hope they will not scold.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Merry</span>:</p>

<p>I have been long wanting to write to you, so
many of your subscribers have been writing to
you. I could not write to you sooner, because
I did not know my letter would go by the
mail.</p>

<p>Many of the stories in the Museum are quite
interesting. I have often tried to read your
history of your own life, through. I should
have begun when your Museum first came out,
but it happened that I did not. “Philip
Brusque” I began too, but, as my brother was
going up the river in a steamboat, he wanted
to take the number, so that I had to leave off
reading it.</p>

<p>In your number before the last I liked the
“Two Friends.” Many of the children like
“The Siberian Sable-hunter,” but I do not
fancy it much, as there are so many hard names
in it.</p>

<p>I am one of your little black-eyed subscribers:
my brother Benjamin is one of your
blue-eyed subscribers. He does not read as
many of your Museums as I do, for he is away
from home a great part of the time, and when
he gets home he hardly ever thinks of reading
them. I am always glad when I hear that
your Museum is come, and yet, the last time,
they kept it from me for a day and a night.
Was not that very hard?</p>

<p>My little sister, Lydia, is yet too young to
read, and does not even know her A, B, C; but
I know them well enough. I like your plain,
simple stories best. I believe my brother likes
the ones that are not simple. In your number,
a great while ago, is a song by the name of
“Jack Frost,” which I like very much, and
many other pieces of your poetry. “Discontented
Betty” I like too. I have been hurrying
off with my lessons, so that I could write to
you; but, pray, do not think that I write this
myself, for I do not even know how to make a
letter. My sister writes for me.</p>

<p>I am in constant fear that we shall have to
give up your Museum, but I hope we shall not.
I thought that I would have to send my letter
by the man that brought the Museum, but my
father told me that I need not, but that I should
send it by the mail. I hope your Museum will
not end very soon, but will keep on a long
while. I have found out three of your names,
Parley, Merry and Goodrich. I want to see
you very much. My sister Mary is collecting
autographs, and has got one of yours, which I
think to be quite a decent hand for such an
old man. I hope this letter will reach you
safely. I wonder if the one my brother William
wrote to you, a long time ago, ever reached
you.</p>

<p>I have read some of your other books, as we
have got some others. I consider myself a
very poor reader, if others do not. I had a
beautiful book given to me on New Year’s day,
by the name of “Flower People.” But I cannot
think of anything more to say, and so, Mr.
Merry, good-bye.</p>

<p class="right r2">
E. O. B.<br>
</p>

<p>P.S. I have thought of one other thing to
say, Mr. Merry, and it is that I wish you
would answer this letter.</p>

<i>The return of our party.—Sports and festivities.</i><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> I had been about a month in
the village, a swift Indian, despatched by
the warriors who had been absent on an
expedition against some distant tribes,
came in, and announced that the whole
party were near at hand, and would
enter the village the following morning.
Preparations were therefore made to
receive them.</p>

<p>All was bustle and activity, though
this seemed to consist more in running
about, and chattering like a set of magpies,
than anything else. The children
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_66">66</span>
leaped, frolicked, shouted, and fought
mimic battles as well as real ones, in
which they bit, scratched, kicked and
pulled hair, in honor of the coming celebration.
The women went about from
tent to tent, talking with great animation
and keeping up the hum, which might be
heard at the farther extremity of the
village.</p>

<p>Evening at last came, but there was
no cessation of the excitement. The
greater part of the night was spent in
talking, squabbling, dancing, jumping,
leaping and yelling. At length the
morning came, and just as the sun was
rising, an Indian, painted blue and red,
carrying on his head the skin taken
from the pate of a grizzly bear, was seen
creeping along in the edge of the adjacent
wood. He was soon followed by
another, painted in a similar manner,
with the horns and pate of a buffalo
upon his head. Others succeeded, all
of them painted and dressed in the most
wild and fantastic manner, until about
a hundred warriors had gathered in the
thickets of the forest, close to the village.</p>

<p>A pause of at least half an hour ensued.
All within the wood was silent,
and not a trace of the savages that lurked
in its bosom, could be discovered.
The women, children and old men of
the village had gathered in the open
space encircled by the tents, where they
awaited the coming spectacle in breathless
expectation.</p>

<p>At last, a wild yell, as if a thousand
demons filled the air, broke from the
forest. In an instant after, the warriors
started from their cover and ran toward
the village with the greatest swiftness.
Approaching the group of women and
children, they formed themselves in a
circle and began to dance in a most
violent manner. They leaped, jumped,
ran, brandished their weapons, screamed,
chattered, and appeared more like infernal
spirits than human creatures. They
were all on foot except about a dozen,
who were on horseback, and attired in
the most fantastic manner. These rode
round the circle with great swiftness,
flourishing their long spears, and performing
a sort of wild mimic battle.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more fierce and
frightful than the whole scene, yet the
women and children were greatly delighted,
and evinced their ecstasy by
uproarious acclamations. The warriors
were excited by this applause to greater
feats, and for about an hour they kept
up their savage revel. They seemed to
be as proud of their greasy paint and
their savage foppery, as a well-dressed
company of militia marching on a muster-day
through one of our villages. A
bear’s or buffalo’s pate was fully equal
to a cocked hat; a raccoon’s or oppossum’s
hide was equivalent to a pair of
epaulettes; the bow and arrow were an
offset to the sword.</p>

<p>But the Indian warriors had one advantage
over our training-day soldiers.
They had been in actual service, and
carried with them evidences of their
victory. Several of them bore in their
hands large bundles of bloody scalps,
which they had taken from their enemies,
and these they flourished in the
faces of the admiring spectators. It is
obvious that the same vanity and foppery
which are found in the fair-weather
soldiers of towns and cities, belong to
the savage warrior of the wilderness.</p>

<p>At length, the ceremony was over,
and the savages dispersed themselves to
their several wigwams. The next day,
however, they had a great exhibition,
which was a kind of war-dance, in
which the warriors attempted to exhibit
their several battles and exploits. It
was in fact a sort of pantomime, in which
several of the Indians displayed great
powers of mimicry. Though I was not
much accustomed to these things, I understood
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_67">67</span>
a good deal of what the Indians
meant by their performances.</p>

<p>One of these fellows amused me very
much. He seemed to be fond of fun,
and, like the clown in a circus, appeared
to think more of making a laugh than
anything else. It seemed from his representation,
that, on one occasion, he was
sent to spy out the situation of a party
of Indians, whom they intended to
attack. It was night, and as he was
proceeding along a deer path in the
forest, he chanced to see a skunk immediately
before him. The creature stood
still, and positively refused to stir a
step.</p>

<p>The Indian hesitated for some time
what to do, but at last he put an arrow
to the bowstring, and shot the impertinent
animal to the heart. The air was,
however, immediately filled with the creature’s
effluvia, and the Indians, whom
the spy was seeking, being ever on the
watch, were startled by the circumstance,
and the spy himself was obliged to retreat
for safety. This whole story was
easily comprehended from the admirable
mimicry of the actor. Nothing could
exceed his drollery, except the applause
of the spectators. He seemed to have
the reputation of an established wag,
and, like Andrews at the late Tremont
Theatre, he could hardly turn his eye,
or crook his finger, but the action was
followed with bursts of applause.</p>

<p>There was one thing that characterized
all the warriors, and that was a love
of boasting and self-glorification. Every
one represented himself as a hero and
as performing the most wonderful feats
of strength and valor. Boasting, I
suspect, is a thing that naturally belongs
to those who have little refinement, and
modesty is doubtless the fruit of those
finer sentiments which belong to civilization.</p>

<p>For several days there were sports
and festivities, and every one seemed to
give himself up to amusement. The
warriors had brought home with them a
young Indian prisoner, who was about
eighteen years old. He was a fine,
proud-looking fellow, and when he was
brought out and encircled by all the
Indians, he seemed to survey them with
a kind of scorn. He was tied to a stake,
and the young Indians, stationed at a
certain distance, were allowed to shoot
their arrows at him. Several of them
hit him, and the blood trickled freely
down his body. He stood unmoved,
however, and seemed not to notice the
wounds. The women then surrounded
him, and jeered at him, making mouths,
and pinching his flesh, and punching
him with sharp sticks.</p>

<p>At last, it was determined by the warriors,
to let him loose upon the prairie
and give him a chance of escape. The
warriors were to pursue him. If he was
retaken, he was to die; if he outran his
pursuers, he was to have his liberty.</p>

<p>The prisoner was unbound and placed
at the distance of about six rods in advance
of those who were to pursue him;
the signal was given, and he departed.
He seemed fleet as the mountain deer,
and life was the wager for which he ran.
He was, however, pursued by more than
a dozen Indians, scarcely less lightfooted
than himself. He struck across the
prairie, which lay stretched out for several
miles, almost as level as the sea,
and in the distance, was skirted by the
forest.</p>

<p>He kept in advance of his pursuers,
who strained every nerve to overtake
him. On he flew, casting an occasional
glance backward. The yells broke often
from his pursuers, but he was silent. It
was for life that he fled, and he would
not waste a breath. On he sped, and as
he and his followers seemed to grow less
and less in the distance, my eyes grew
weary of the scene. But such was the
interest that I felt for the poor fugitive
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_68">68</span>
that I kept my gaze bent upon the chase
for almost an hour.</p>

<p>The Indians seemed at last in the
remote distance to be dwindled to the
size of insects; they still strained every
limb, though they seemed scarcely to
move; they still yelled with all their
might, but only an occasional faint echo
reached our ears. At last, the fugitive
plunged into the forest; his pursuers
followed, and they were lost to the view.
After the lapse of several hours, the pursuing
party returned, without their prisoner.
He was at liberty in the unbounded
forest.</p>

<h2>
The Smuggler.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Who</span> would imagine that a dog had
been made serviceable as a clerk, and
thus made for his master upwards of
a hundred thousand crowns? And yet
an incident like this happened upwards
of forty years since. One of those industrious
beings who know how to live
by skinning flints, determined, in extreme
poverty, to engage in trade. He preferred
that species of merchandise which
occupied the least space, and was calculated
to yield the greatest profit. He
borrowed a small sum of money from a
friend, and repairing to Flanders, he
there bought pieces of lace, which he
smuggled into France in the following
manner.</p>

<p>He trained an active spaniel to his
purpose. He caused him to be shaved,
and procured for him the skin of another
dog, of the same hair and the same shape.
He then rolled his lace round the body
of his dog, and put over it the garment
of the stranger so adroitly, that it was
impossible to discover the trick. The
lace being thus arranged, he would say
to his docile messenger, “Forward, my
friend.” At the words, the dog would
start, and pass boldly through the gates
of Malines or Valenciennes, in the face
of the vigilant officer placed there to
prevent smuggling. Having thus passed
the bounds, he would wait his master
at a little distance in the open country.
There they mutually caressed and
feasted, and the merchant placed his
rich packages in a place of security,
renewing his occupation as occasion required.
Such was the success of this
smuggler that in less than five or six
years he amassed a handsome fortune
and kept his coach.</p>

<p>Envy pursues the prosperous. A mischievous
neighbor at length betrayed the
lace merchant; notwithstanding all his
efforts to disguise the dog, he was suspected,
watched, and discovered.</p>

<p>But the cunning of the dog was equal
to the emergency. Did the spies of the
custom-house expect him at one gate,—he
saw them at a distance, and instantly
ran to another. Were all the gates shut
against him,—he overcame every obstacle;
sometimes he leaped over the wall; at
others, passing secretly behind a carriage
or running between the legs of travellers,
he would thus accomplish his aim. One
day, however, while swimming a stream
near Malines, he was shot, and died in
the water. There was then about him
five thousand crowns’ worth of lace—the
loss of which did not afflict his master,
but he was inconsolable for the loss of
his faithful dog.</p>

<h2>
The Poet’s Dog.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> manner in which Pope, the great
English poet, was preserved by the
sagacity of his dog, is truly remarkable.
This animal, who was called Marquis,
could never agree with a favorite
servant of his master’s; he constantly
growled when near him, and would even
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_69">69</span>
show his teeth whenever this servant
approached. Although the poet was
singularly attached to this dog,—who
was a spaniel of the largest species,—yet,
on account of his extreme neatness, which
he pushed almost to excess, he would
never allow him to remain in his chamber.
Nevertheless, in spite of positive
orders, the spaniel would frequently
sneak, towards evening, into the apartment
of his master, and would not be
driven from it without the greatest difficulty.</p>

<p>One evening, having slipped very
softly in without being perceived, the
animal placed himself under the bed of
his master, and remained there. Towards
morning, the servant rushed hastily
into the chamber of Pope. At this
moment, the dog suddenly left his post
and leaped on the villain, who was
armed with a pistol. The poet started
from his sleep; he threw open the
window to call for assistance, and beheld
three highwaymen, who had been introduced
by his servant into the garden of
his villa, for the purpose of robbing him.
Disconcerted by this unforeseen accident,
the robbers hesitated a moment, and then
took flight. The servant, thus betrayed
by the watchful dog, was sentenced to
forfeit his life.</p>

<p>The same dog, shortly after this singular
event, exhibited another proof of
his remarkable instinct. Pope, reposing
one afternoon in a little wood about
twelve miles distant from his house, lost
a watch of great value. On returning
home, the poet wished to know the hour,
and found his watch was not in his fob.
Two or three hours had elapsed, and a
violent storm was just commencing.</p>

<p>The poet called his dog, and making
a sign, which Marquis very well understood,
he said, “I have lost my watch—go
look for it.” At these words Marquis
departed, and repaired, no doubt, to every
spot at which his master stopped. It
happened that the poor animal was so
long occupied in the search as to create
great anxiety, for midnight had arrived,
and he had not returned. What was the
astonishment of Pope, when, on rising in
the morning, he opened his chamber
door, and there beheld his faithful messenger
lying quietly and holding in his
mouth the splendid jewel, with which he
had returned perfectly uninjured, and
which was the more highly valued by
the poet, as it had been presented to him
by the queen of England.</p>

<h2>
A Shark Story.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> years ago, while sitting on the
quarter-deck of a West Indiaman, borne
rapidly along before the trade wind, the
captain and passengers were amusing
themselves by telling stories and cracking
jokes to beguile the sameness of the
voyage. It came at last to the turn of a
gentleman remarkable for his love of
cigars and taciturnity; one who enjoyed
a good anecdote, but abhorred the trouble
of relating it himself. He was, however,
so strongly importuned on this occasion,
that with much reluctance he related the
following, by fits and starts, filling up
each pause by vigorous whiffs of his
favorite <span class="lock">weed:—</span></p>

<p>In the year 1820, the good ship Rambler
sailed from Greenock, with goods
and passengers, towards Jamaica. She
had crossed the tropic. One day, when
nearly becalmed, the steward, who had
the care of the captain’s plate, had occasion,
after dinner, to wash some spoons
and other articles in a bucket, and thinking
he had taken all out of the water,
he chucked it over the gangway, when,
to his vexation, he found he had thrown
out with it a valuable silver table spoon.
He saw it shining through the clear blue
ocean, and wavering from side to side
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_70">70</span>
as it sank from his view. Several
sharks had been observed near the ship,
and it is known they generally dart upon
anything white, a piece of rag often
serving for a bait. He did not, however,
observe any of them near the spot at the
time; and the captain being a testy man,
he kept the secret of the loss to himself,
and the matter was soon forgotten.</p>

<p>The ship in due time reached Jamaica,
and when the circumstance became
known, the value of the spoon was deducted
from the wages of the steward.
The vessel lay some time at Kingston,
received on board a cargo of sugar, and
proceeded on her homeward voyage.
When crossing nearly the same spot on
the aqueous world where the spoon was
lost, a number of sharks again showed
their tail fins above the water as they
cut along the ship’s side, or in her wake;
and a shark hook being baited with a
piece of salt pork, was lowered over the
stern. Presently one of the largest of
these devouring monsters, or, as the
sailors call them, “<em>Sea Lawyers</em>,” half
turning on its side, took the huge bait
into his pig-like but tremendous jaws,
and was securely hooked.</p>

<p>The fish was with difficulty hauled
alongside and hoisted on deck, where it
flapped about and showed prodigious
strength and tenacity of life. When its
struggles were ended by a blow on the
head with a mallet, one of the men proceeded
to open it. His jack-knife soon
came in contact with something in its
belly, and—said the narrator, with
earnestness, “what do you think was
really found?” “Why, the spoon, of
course!” exclaimed the listeners simultaneously.
“The spoon!” he rejoined,
with a smile, “No! no!” “What
then?” they hastily inquired. “Why,
nothing but the entrails, to be sure!”</p>

<p>The taciturnity of the waggish messmate
was not again disturbed for another
story during the voyage.
</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Joyful Meeting.</span>—A few days since,
at Buffalo, a boat load of Germans landed
from the canal, evidently direct from
Germany. Among them was an old lady
and some three or four children, quite
grown up. Several tavern-keepers were
around the boat, as is customary, to
solicit patronage from the emigrants, and
one of these approached the old lady,
who, immediately upon seeing him,
threw herself upon his neck and wept.
The children also embraced him, and
tears and smiles alternately bore their
sway.</p>

<p>The explanation of the scene given
was, that the old lady was on her way
to Detroit in search of her husband, who
had emigrated some years previous, and
she had thus unexpectedly fallen upon
him at this place. What a meeting!</p>

to excite laughter, than that of the
person whose portrait we have given
above. He was servant of an inn at
Ripon, in Yorkshire, England, where it
was part of his duty to wait upon travellers
and take charge of boots and shoes.
Hence, he went under the title of Old
Boots.</p>

<p>It was his custom to introduce himself
into the room, with a pair of slippers
in one hand and a boot-jack in the other.
His features at once amazed and diverted
every visitor; for nature had given him
such length of nose and chin, and
brought them so near together, that he
could hold a piece of money between
them, like a thumb and finger, or a pair
of nippers. This feat he was always
ready to perform, and he became, in fact,
the great curiosity of the place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is nothing more easy than to
find fault, particularly after a little practice;
for the thing grows upon us as we
get used to it. Of all countries, there is
none that furnishes such inveterate fault-finders,
as England. Many of them are
very much addicted to grumbling, even
in their own country; but when out of
it, everything goes wrong. The other
day I saw a boy with a snapping turtle,
which he had just taken out of a muddy
pond. The creature was very savage—and
if you pointed your finger at him,
he would snap at you in the most spiteful
manner. Nothing could move
around him, but he would snap at it.
I must confess that when I looked at the
creature, he put me in mind of Captain
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_72">72</span>
Hall, Mrs. Trollope, Major Hamilton,
and other English travellers, who have
visited our country, and gone home and
reviled everything they saw.</p>

<p>But we must now turn to the subject
of the present article, Joseph Cappur,
whose portrait is placed at the head of
this article, and whom we call Captain
Snarly. He lived at a place near London,
called Kensington, and though he
was rich, his habits were exceedingly
stingy. He was chiefly famous for his
love of finding fault; and he loved nothing
so well as a snarling companion.
One day, as he was walking about the
place, he came to a small tavern. He
entered, and asked the landlord if he
could furnish him lodgings. “No!”
said the landlord, fiercely—and then ordered
him out of the house. This
pleased old Snarly so much, that he immediately
took up his abode at the place,
and there he lived for twenty-five years.
His greatest sport was to poke fun at the
landlord and make him mad with fury.</p>

<p>Old Snarly was a great politician and
a champion of the king. He would let
nobody speak ill of either. He hated
the French, and one of his chief occupations
was to kill flies, which he called
Frenchmen. He died at the age of
seventy-two, and left one hundred and
fifty thousand dollars to his relatives,
whom he would not see while he was
living.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> man was wonderful for the power
he had over the muscles of his face.
Though he had not a long nose, yet he
could move it in such a manner as to
take a piece of money up from a table
between his nose and chin, and hold it
there firmly. Nay more, he could draw
his nose down in such a manner as to
take it into his mouth, and then his under
lip appeared even with his eyes and
forehead! He could also put the stem
of a tobacco pipe through his nose, and
then take up a wine glass and hold it
between his nose and chin, as shown in
the portrait.</p>

<p>The performances of this man astonished
all who saw him, and several eminent
medical men expressed great wonder
at his feats. He was both a sailor
and a soldier, in the British service, and
served in the revolutionary war, in
America. He was twice married, and
had a family of thirteen children. His
life was one of great vicissitude, and
when an old man, he was famous at
Wapping, for his stories about what he
had seen and done. He had a good
opinion of himself, and used generally
to wind off his long tales with the
declaration that his equal was not to be

<h2 class="no-break">
Punch and Judy.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are some wise old people, who,
when they hear the music of the showmen
in the streets, are very much annoyed,
and wish to have the vagrants
sent off to the work-house. Gently—gently—Mr.
Snarl. This very exhibition
of Punch and Judy, has given more
innocent pleasure than almost any other
that was ever invented.</p>

<p>The story of Punch and his wife Judy,
had its origin in Italy. As it is a pleasant
story, I will tell it. In the district
of Acezza, near Naples, the people are
very much addicted to the making of
wine from grapes; and it is curious that
from antiquity they have been famous
for their love of droll wit and comic fun.</p>

<p>Well, many years ago, in the season
of the vintage, which is a time when
everybody seems to be full of joke and
frolic, some comic players came along,
through Acezza. They began to poke
fun at the vintagers, and in the war of
wit, the players got the worst of it.</p>

<p>Now there was, among the vintagers,
a fellow with an enormous red nose,
long and crooked like a powder horn;
and he was the very drollest and wittiest
of the whole company. The players
were so tickled with his witty sayings,
all set off by his odd face and very queer
air and manner, that they almost cracked
their sides with laughter.</p>

<p>After they went away, they began to
think that this droll fellow would be a
great accession to their company: so
they went back and made offers to him.
These he accepted; and such was the
success of his efforts that the company
acquired great fame and a great deal of
money. Everybody went to see this
witty buffoon, and all were delighted.</p>

<p>This example led to the establishment
of a droll or buffoon in all companies of
comedians; and he was always called
after the original one, whose name was
Pucco d’Aniello. This was, in the
course of time, softened into Polecenello;
the French made it Polichenel, and the
English, Punchinello. After a time, the
English, for the sake of brevity, left off
the latter part of the word, and called it
plain Punch.</p>

<p>How Judy originated, history does
not tell us; but it is easy to smell out
her story. Such a merry fellow as
Punch has as good a right to a wife as
anybody, if he can get one. Why not?
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_74">74</span>
You may think that his beet-like nose
would stand in the way of his finding a
woman willing to marry him; but his
wit is a fair offset to this. Women are
fond of wit, and Punch would play his
part ill, if he could not make it cover his
nose.</p>

<p>Well, we now suppose Punch to have
a wife, and also suppose her name to be
Judy. What, then, is more natural than
for this amiable couple, now and then,
to have a bit of a breeze? They live a
wandering life, and do, like other people
in their station, take a little liquor to
raise their spirits. After the effect is
over, feeling a little peevish, they fall
to calling each other hard names, and
hard blows follow, as natural as life.
So here is the whole history, fairly made
out.</p>

<p>Gentle reader! if you are young, you
will not quarrel with the showmen,
nay, you will stand by, clap your hands
and pay your pence. If you are old,
consider that you were once young, and
tolerate the innocent exhibition, in behalf
of those who are now what you
were some half century ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petrarch.</span>—Petrarch, the celebrated
Italian poet, recommended himself to
the confidence and affection of Cardinal
Coloma, in whose family he resided, by
his candor and strict regard to truth. A
violent quarrel occurred in the household
of this nobleman, which was carried
so far that recourse was had to arms.
The cardinal wished to know the foundation
of this affair; and, that he might
be able to decide with justice, he assembled
all his people, and obliged them to
bind themselves by a most solemn oath
to declare the whole truth. Every one
submitted to the examination; even the
cardinal’s own brother was not excused.
Petrarch, in his turn, presented himself
to take the oath; the cardinal said, “As
to you, Petrarch, your word is sufficient!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the river Tennessee, in former
times, there was situated a fort, called
<em>Fort Loudon</em>. This fort was far back
in the woods, 500 miles from Charleston,
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_75">75</span>
and at a distance from any white
settlement. It was built in 1756, for
the purpose of preventing the encroachments
of the French, who used to steal
down from Canada, and annoy the white
English inhabitants, who were forming
settlements in that part of the country.
At the same time, it was a safeguard
against the Indians, numerous tribes of
whom lived round about. These Indians,
at all times savage and cruel,
were particularly hostile to the whites;
and more so, as they perceived them
forming settlements in their neighborhood.</p>

<p>In the above fort, at the time my story
commences, there were but few soldiers.
This fact the Indians, by some means,
discovered, and they determined to make
an attack upon it; and, if possible, to
massacre the soldiers.</p>

<p>The plan was conducted, as usual,
with much secrecy and cunning; and,
before the soldiers were aware, the fort
was surrounded by a large number of
savages, thirsting only for their blood.
The fort was strong, however; the gates
were shut, and the Indians found it impossible
to enter. But they could watch
it. They might perhaps in time force
the soldiers to surrender, because their
provisions could not last always. A
guard was, therefore, constantly kept
round about; and so vigilant were they,
that not a single white man durst venture
abroad, nor could any come to their
assistance.</p>

<p>For a time, the provisions in the fort
held out well; but, at length, the soldiers
were obliged to resort to the flesh
of their horses and dogs, which, by
reason of scanty food, had dwindled
away nearly to skeletons. For two
long months, however, the soldiers bore
up under the pressure of confinement,
and stinted fare. The enemy that surrounded
them, they well knew, were at
all times savage and cruel; but <em>now</em> they
would be doubly so, having become exasperated
by watching for so long a
period.</p>

<p>The soldiers had stout hearts and
good courage; but, at length, they told
their officers, that they could hold out no
longer. Upon this, the officers came
together, and, after due consultation, it
was agreed to surrender, and to obtain
the best treatment from the Indians they
were able.</p>

<p>There was one man among them,
whom the Indians esteemed. His name
was <em>Captain Stewart</em>. He was accordingly
selected to inform the Indians that
they had held out sufficiently long, and
were willing to surrender, provided they
were treated kindly.</p>

<p>In reply, the Indians told Captain
Stewart that they might march out with
their guns, and a little powder and shot;
but that they must leave the fort that very
day. The Indians added, that they
would accompany them to Fort George,
where their white brethren lived.</p>

<p>As these were better terms than were
expected, the English officers did not
hesitate to accept them. They marched
out accordingly, and that very day set
out upon their journey for Fort George.
It was noon when they left the fort,
and night before they paused.</p>

<p>Wearied with their toilsome march,
they soon laid themselves down to rest.
Just as they were doing this, they perceived
that the whole body of Indians
were leaving them. The object of this
movement they were unable to explain;
but, well knowing how cunning and
treacherous the Indians were, they could
sleep no more. A few, perhaps, more
weary than the others, were occasionally
lost for a few minutes; but the painful
state of anxiety in which they were, made
their sleep short and unrefreshing. Several
hours passed in this state of suspense;
but as no Indians came near them,
they began to indulge the hope, that the
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_76">76</span>
enemy had left them, to return no more.
They, therefore, generally laid themselves
down, and one after another became
lost in sound sleep. About the
dawn of day, one of the men, who had
been placed as a guard, came running, in
great haste, to inform them that a large
body of Indians were secretly approaching.</p>

<p>The alarm was instantly given, and
the men ordered to stand to their arms.
The summons, however, was so sudden,
and the terror so universal, that not a single
soldier had his gun loaded when the
tremendous war-whoop broke upon them.
The onset of the savages, upon this comparatively
feeble and unprepared band,
was so furious, that resistance was in
vain. Some were killed, and the rest
taken prisoners. Captain Stewart had
his hands tied behind him, and at the
head of the others, was led back to the fort.</p>

<p>On their arrival, an Indian chief, taking
Captain Stewart by the hand, conducted
him to his own hut, unbound his
arms, and fed him from his own bowl.
This was <em>Attakullakulla</em>. A few days
following, the Indians held a great council
about the disposal of the prisoners.
The chiefs were all present, and, though
some differed for a time from others, in
conclusion, they sent for Captain Stewart,
and informed him that they were
about proceeding to the attack of Fort
George. “You and your men,” said
they, “will accompany us. You will
fight with us. This is the result of our
talk!”</p>

<p>“You must do more,” added they.
“Write to the captain of Fort George—tell
him of our coming—tell him that if
he surrenders the fort peaceably, it is
well—if not, we will strip his friend
Captain Stewart, and burn him before
his eyes.”</p>

<p>This was indeed cruel. Captain Stewart
seated himself; and, in the presence
of the savages, wrote the letter required;

but he thought within himself, that before
he would fight his brethren, he
would undergo the pains, even of savage
torture. On returning home, said he to
Attakullakulla, “You are my friend.
You have shown your friendship, in the
hour of danger and of trial. Now, can
you show it again?—I cannot fight my
brethren—I must escape, or I must die.”</p>

<p>Attakullakulla replied, “I have been
your friend once; I will be so again.
You must not fight your brethren. The
red men must not kill you. Come with
me, and I will take you far from the
reach of the bloody tomahawk.”</p>

<p>Before the next morning, Attakullakulla
and Captain Stewart were far on
their journey, in the depths of the wilderness.
By day, they travelled with
great expedition, and at night slept upon
the open ground. The sun and moon
served as guides to the sagacious Indian
chief; and, as they kept on over hills
and mountains, valleys and rivers, Captain
Stewart wondered where their journey
would end. On the <em>fourteenth</em> day,
they saw fires at a distance, and they
knew that men were near. As they
came nearer, they met a party of
soldiers, who told them that they were
in <em>Virginia</em>, and that this was the camp
of <em>Colonel Bird</em>. They told them to go
on further, where they would see Colonel
Bird himself. When they came up to
this officer, Captain Stewart introduced
himself and his Indian friend to the
colonel. He was delighted to hear of
his escape, and was much pleased with
the friendship which the Indian had
shown to the white man. “This,” said
he, “is <em>true friendship</em>, which shows
itself in action, not in words.”</p>

<p>When Attakullakulla said he must depart
that night, the two officers begged
him to remain with them for a few days.
But the old man said, “No.” When
they found that he could not be persuaded,
they loaded him with presents
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_77">77</span>
of all kinds, and bidding him “Farewell,”
they saw him depart for his home.
On his return to his tribe, he met some
soldiers, who told him they had been
sent from <em>Fort George</em>, the place which
the Indians were going to attack. They
said that the captain of Fort George
had received their letter, and had heard
that they were coming to fight him.
But he desired Attakullakulla to inform
his brethren, that they must not come
to Fort George; for that there was much
powder and ball buried in holes around
the fort to blow up any enemies, who
might come; and that if they dared to
come, they would certainly be blown in
pieces.</p>

<p>The chief promised the soldiers that
he would tell the Indians of this, and
again proceeded on his way. On reaching
Fort Loudon, he called the Indians
together, and told them of the word that
the white men had sent them. They
were much frightened, when they heard
of the powder and shot, and blessed the
Good Spirit that he had not permitted
them to attack the fort, as they must all
have been killed.</p>

<p>But to return to Capt. Stewart. Now
that he had himself escaped, he began
to think of the poor soldiers whom he
had left in captivity. For a time he
could hear nothing of their fate; and
was in doubt, whether his escape might
not have led to the massacre of them all.
But, at length, he had the pleasure to
know, by means of one who had escaped
like himself, that they were alive, though
still in captivity.</p>

<p>Upon this intelligence, he collected
such articles, as he thought would be
acceptable to the Indians—beads, buttons,
red belts, &amp;c., and sent them to his
old friend, Attakullakulla, and begged
him to divide them among the chiefs,
and to ask them that their white prisoners
might be sent to him in return.
The presents proved acceptable to the
Indians; and, in the fulness of their joy,
they said they must send something in
return to their friend Captain Stewart;
but for an appropriate present they were
quite at a loss. Attakullakulla told
them he could help them out of their
difficulty, and now informed them of the
request of Captain Stewart. To this,
they unanimously assented, and forthwith
communicated to their prisoners
that they were at liberty.</p>

<p>The joy of the prisoners need not be
told. Under the guidance of the man
whom Capt. Stewart had sent with the
presents, they were conducted in safety
to Fort George, where they had the
pleasure to meet once more their friend
and benefactor, Captain Stewart, and to
thank him in person for his kind remembrance
of them in the land of their captivity.</p>

<p>From the above story it may be useful
to remark, that although Indians
have many bad traits of character, yet
they are not destitute of good ones.
This good chief, Attakullakulla, saved, by
his faithfulness, the life of his friend,
and was the means through him, of saving
all the other prisoners. It is an excellent
thing to be faithful to our friends.
“A friend in need is a friend indeed.”—So
Captain Stewart found it.</p>

A Droll Mimic.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A clergyman</span> of some distinction once
had a tame baboon which became so
fond of him, that wherever he went it
was always desirous of accompanying
him. Whenever, therefore, he had to
perform the service of his church, he
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_78">78</span>
was under the necessity of shutting it up
in his room.</p>

<p>Once, however, the animal escaped,
and followed his master to the church;
where, silently mounting the sounding-board
above the pulpit, he lay perfectly
still till the sermon commenced. He
then crept to the edge, and overlooking
the preacher, imitated his gestures in so
grotesque a manner that the whole congregation
were unavoidably made to
laugh.</p>

<p>The minister, surprised and confounded
at this levity, severely rebuked his
audience for their conduct. The reproof
failed of its intended effect; the congregation
still laughed, and the preacher, in
the warmth of his zeal, redoubled his
vociferation and action; this last the ape
imitated so exactly that the congregation
could no longer restrain themselves, but
burst out into one long and continued
roar of laughter.</p>

<p>A friend of the preacher at length
stepped up to him and pointed out the
cause of this apparently improper conduct;
and such was the arch demeanor
of the animal, that it was with the
utmost difficulty that the parson himself
could maintain his gravity, while he
ordered the servants of the church to
take the creature away.</p>

Whale Stories.<br>
</h2>
<h4 class="small">
CONTEST ABOUT A WHALE.<br>
</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a custom among whalemen, that
whenever a whale gets loose, even although
it may have once been taken by a
crew, it is considered a free prize to any
one who can seize it.</p>

<p>Several years since, two ships, which
were in search of whales, happened at
the same time to approach one, which
was dead, and which was lying in some
broken ice, not far distant from a large
field of ice.</p>

<p>No sooner had the respective crews
discovered the whale, than each made
all possible sail to reach it before the
other. On each bow of the two ships
was stationed a harpooner with his appropriate
instrument, in readiness to discharge
it the first moment they should
be sufficiently near. But it so happened
that the ships came in contact with each
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_79">79</span>
other, when within a few yards of the
fish, and being under full sail, the shock
was so severe, as to do considerable
damage to both.</p>

<p>The harpooners, however, intent on
their prey, both discharged their harpoons
at the same instant; and both fell
short of their mark. Observing this, a
hardy seaman belonging to one of the
ships leaped overboard, and urging his
way through the water, reached the fish,
and seizing one of its fins, proclaimed it
a lawful prize.</p>

<p>But the fish being greatly swollen,
and withal quite slippery, the sailor was
unable to climb upon it but was obliged
to remain in the water, until assistance
could be sent. This was no pleasant
sport, for the water was intensely cold,
and the poor fellow was seen quite benumbed.</p>

<p>Elated with this good luck, his captain
forgot to send a boat, as he should
have done, to relieve him; but gave orders
to moor the vessel to an adjoining
piece of ice.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the other vessel
tacked, and the master stepping into a
boat pushed off and rowed towards the
dead fish. On reaching it, and observing
the poor fellow still holding on to
the fish, but quite benumbed, he observed,
“Well, my lad, you have a fine
fish here.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” replied the seaman,
“something of a fish, to be sure.”</p>

<p>“But an’t you cold here in the
water?”</p>

<p>“That I am,” said the shivering sailor—his
teeth chattering so that he could
scarcely utter the words. “Will you
let me come on board your boat until
ours arrives?”</p>

<p>This was readily acceded to, and the
poor fellow was assisted over the boat’s
side. But no sooner was he fairly on,
than the captain seized a harpoon, and
darting it into the fish, raised a flag and
claimed it as his lawful prize.</p>

<p>Though it was a hard case, by the
rules of whale-fisheries this was considered
altogether right. The disappointed
captain, having no redress, withdrew
his vessel, leaving to his competitor a
valuable prize, which he had lost through
a very foolish neglect.</p>
<br>

<h4 class="small">
DISTRESSING ADVENTURE OF FOURTEEN
WHALEMEN.<br>
</h4>

<p>In the year 1813, the ship Volunteer,
meeting with a severe gale, near a large
piece of ice, in a high latitude, the captain
deemed it expedient to set an anchor
in the ice, to prevent his ship from being
driven out to sea.</p>

<p>For this purpose a boat was manned
with fourteen men, who proceeded to
the ice with the anchor. At the same
time, the ship was brought as near as
possible; but no sooner was the anchor
fastened to the ice, than a wave, dashing
against the vessel, pulled the anchor from
its fastenings, and she went adrift.</p>

<p>Before the sails could be properly set,
she had reached a considerable distance.
In attempting to near and return, the
ship fell to leeward, and was driven out
to sea.</p>

<p>This, to the poor seamen left behind,
was a terrible disaster. The air was
intensely cold. They were fourteen in
number—with only a small open boat,
insufficient to support them in such a
gale as was prevailing—without shelter—without
food—and on a detached piece
of ice, which was liable every hour to
float out to sea.</p>

<p>In this distressing situation, what
should they do? Some advised to remain
on the ice; but this might be
broken by the increasing swell. Others
were anxious to attempt to join the ship,
while she was yet in sight; but the
force of the wind, and the violence of
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_80">80</span>
the sea, rendered such an attempt little
short of madness.</p>

<p>At length, however, the majority decided
on the latter course; and having
embarked, they launched forth on the
swelling tide. But soon it was perceived
to be all in vain—the boat could not live
even a quarter of an hour, and their
only safety lay in again returning to the
ice. But even this was found to be impracticable.
Each one now viewed his
situation as desperate; and every moment
expected to be engulfed in the
rolling waters.</p>

<p>At this critical juncture,—this moment
of deep despair,—suddenly and almost
miraculously, as it seemed to them, a
ship hove in sight. She was indeed
bounding over the tumultuous waves—but
she was advancing directly towards
them.</p>

<p>But would she see them, and if seen,
could they be taken on board in such a
storm as was sweeping over the main?
Fortunately, a small flag was in the boat.
This was unfurled, and, streaming as it
did in the wind, attracted the notice of
the people on board the ship. The humane
captain and his crew, from the
first moment, determined, if possible, to
afford them relief. This was difficult, and
even perilous. But it might be done—and
it was done. A kind Providence
smiled upon the attempt, and the poor
seamen, to their inexpressible joy, were
rescued from a watery grave.</p>

<p>The ship proved to be the Lively,
from the same port as their own vessel;
and from their townsmen and acquaintances
they had the pleasure to receive
every token of kindness and affection
which their pitiable condition required.

<h2>
The Life of Columbus.<br>
</h2>
<h3>
<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="Two"><span class="allsmcap">II.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>
</div>

<p class="hanging"><i>Columbus sails on his first voyage—He continues
his course.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> third of August, 1496, was a
memorable day to Columbus and to the
world. On the morning of that day the
sails of the three vessels were seen by
the inhabitants of Palos, spread for the
voyage. To Columbus it was a joyful
occasion,—to many of the people it was
a season of gloom. Several of them had
friends on board. They were now to
bid them farewell, and they could not
believe but that it would be final. They
had little confidence in the success of
the enterprise. Even the sailors appeared
dejected. Many tears, it is said,
were shed that morning, and loud
lamentations were heard as the sails
rose to the wind.</p>

<p>All things being in readiness, orders
were issued to make sail. The vessels
were soon gallantly ploughing their
way through the deep, while the flag of
Columbus was streaming to the wind on
board the Santa Maria.</p>

<p>Many a bright morning is soon overcast
by clouds. It was so with the prospects
of Columbus. He was scarcely
out of sight of land, before a signal of
distress was made from the Pinta. She
had unshipped her rudder, which was
found to be broken. Columbus was not
without his suspicions that the misfortune
was the effect of design, in consequence
of the reluctance of some on
board to continue the voyage. The
misfortune made it necessary for him to
steer for the Canary islands. These
islands are thirteen in number.</p>

<p>Three weeks were here spent in attempting
to find a vessel to take the
place of the Pinta. The effort was unsuccessful.
The broken rudder of the
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_81">81</span>
Pinta was therefore supplied by a new
one.</p>

<p>The vessels being again in readiness,
Columbus left the island of Gomera,
where the above repairs had been made,
on the 6th of September. He now
directed his course westward into the
broad Atlantic.</p>

<p>On the 9th, Ferro, the most western
of the Canary islands, was discovered,
but before the setting in of night no
trace of it remained in sight.</p>

<p>They had now taken leave of their
country. Before them rolled a wide waste
of waters, in the billows of which many
expected to find a grave. Gloom and
dejection seemed to rest heavily on the
brow of many a rugged seaman—some
of whom, even in this beginning of the
voyage, broke out into loud complaints.</p>

<p>Columbus soothed and flattered them.
He was himself confident of success, and
spread before them the prospect of wealth
and honor which he was sure they
would realize.</p>

<p>On the 11th of September, they computed
the distance run from Ferro at
about 450 miles. At this time a mast
was discovered in the water. The ill-boding
seamen doubted not that it belonged
to some unfortunate vessel; and
from this fragment of the wreck, drew
the conclusion that a similar fate was at
no great distance to attend themselves.</p>

<p>September 14th, two birds were seen,
a heron and a water-wagtail. These
were supposed not to venture far from
land: hence, the joy of the seamen
was great. In this instance, however,
their expectations were not realized.</p>

<p>In the course of a few days they fell
in with the trade wind. This wind is
so called because it favors trade. In the
Atlantic Ocean, between the tropics, the
trade winds blow constantly from the
eastward to the westward.</p>

<p>They now went on prosperously and
rapidly. The wind was so steady that
for several days not a sail was shifted.
The sailors would have been delighted
but for one circumstance. If the wind
blew so constantly from east to west how
would they ever be able to return?</p>

<p>On the 18th of September, the wind
from the east still wafting them forward,
Columbus, from frequent experiments,
was of the opinion that the water of the
ocean was hourly growing fresher as
they proceeded. If so, were they not
approaching land?</p>

<p>The thought infused fresh animation
into the crews. Every sail was spread—every
possible exertion made by each to
outstrip the others. At the same time,
every eye which could be spared, was
busily intent in looking for the expected
land. There was a double reason for
this—one was the ardent desire to attain
the object of the voyage—the other was
a promise of a reward of thirty crowns,
or nearly one hundred and twenty dollars,
to the man who should first descry
land. The Pinta, being the best sailor,
generally took the lead, and a signal
from her, that a flock of birds was seen,
served to add to the belief that land was
not far distant.</p>

<p>The prospect of land, however, died
away, and the sailors again began to be
uneasy and dissatisfied. Every day’s
sailing—every propitious wind, was carrying
them farther from home and from
friends. All served to strengthen their
belief that in the wide waters they would
find a last dwelling-place.</p>

<p>On the <abbr title="twenty-third">23d</abbr> of September, the wind
changed and became nearly ahead.
This impeded their progress, but it encouraged
the sailors, as they inferred
from it, that perchance they might be
able to get back again. Other circumstances
at this time also aroused their
spirits. Several birds alighted upon the
ships. These were so small as to induce
the belief that land could not be far
distant, as their strength would not
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_82">82</span>
admit of long-continued flight. Besides
this, they sung so sweetly and with so
much life, that the sailors thought they
could not fear but that they could get
back to land.</p>

<p>But again, soon after, the apprehensions
of the crews were all alive. The
sea appeared on every side to be covered
with weeds. This they supposed to be
an evidence of their approach to shoals
and rocks. These apprehensions were
still farther increased, on the 25th of
September, by an unusual and distressing
swell of the sea. Columbus told
them that it was the effect of a gale
which had subsided. But they believed
him not.</p>

<p>In truth, they had been discontented
from the first of the voyage. They had
given a reluctant consent to the undertaking.
The voyage proved longer than
they expected. If much longer continued,
their provisions might fail—at least
there could be little hope remaining of
their being able to make a safe return.</p>

<p>The growing discontents of the crew
were watched by Columbus with solicitude.
He was a courageous man, and
better able than most men to allay a
rising storm—to dispel fear and despondency.</p>

<p>But at length, complaints, which had
been uttered by one to another, became
louder and louder; and some even went
so far as to talk of casting Columbus
into the sea and sailing forthwith on
their return. In these trying circumstances,
Columbus left no expedient untried
to quell their mutinous spirit.
Some he soothed—some he flattered—others
he threatened.</p>

<p>On the 25th, as they were sailing still
westward, and before a prosperous breeze,
a shout was heard from on board the
Pinta, that land was in sight.</p>

<p>For a time the joy of the crews broke
forth in glory to God. The masts were
climbed—the rigging was filled, and
every eye was strained to catch a glimpse
of the long-desired land. The direction
in which it was supposed to be seen,
was southerly. So strong was the belief
that land had been seen, that Columbus
felt himself compelled to alter his
course, and all that night to steer towards
the object of their search.</p>

<p>The morning, however, brought with
it the same unbroken prospect which had
stretched gloomily before them for so
many weeks. They were now satisfied
that what they had seen was only a
cloud, and which had departed like the
darkness of the night.</p>

<p>The joy which they had experienced
had been suddenly raised—it had risen
high. The disappointment which followed
was severe—and dejection sat
heavily on every countenance.</p>

<h2>
A Monkey Trick.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1818, a vessel that sailed between
Whitehaven (England) and Jamaica, embarked
on her homeward voyage, and
among other passengers, carried Mrs.
B., who had at the breast a child only a
few weeks old. One beautiful afternoon,
the captain perceived a distant sail, and
after he had gratified his curiosity, he
politely offered his glass to the lady,
that she might obtain a clear view of the
object. She had the baby in her arms,
but now she wrapped her shawl about it
and placed it on a sofa upon which she
had been sitting.</p>

<p>Scarcely had she applied her eye to
the glass, when the helmsman exclaimed,
“See what the mischievous monkey has
done.” The reader may judge of the
mother’s feelings, when, on turning
round, she beheld the animal in the
act of transporting her child apparently
to the very top of the mast! The
monkey was a very large one, and so
strong and active, that while it grasped
the infant firmly with one arm, it climbed
the shrouds nimbly by the other, totally
unembarrassed by the weight of its burthen.</p>

<p>One look was sufficient for the terrified
mother, and, had it not been for the
assistance of those around her, she would
have fallen prostrate on the deck, where
she was soon afterwards stretched apparently
a lifeless corpse. The sailors
could climb as well as the monkey, but
the latter watched their motions narrowly;
and as it ascended higher up the
mast the moment they attempted to put
a foot on the shrouds, the captain became
afraid that it would drop the child,
and endeavor to escape by leaping from
one mast to another.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the little innocent
was heard to cry; and though many
thought it was suffering pain, their fears
on this point were speedily dissipated
when they observed the monkey imitating
exactly the motions of a nurse, by
dandling, soothing and caressing its
charge, and even endeavoring to hush it
to sleep.</p>

<p>From the deck the lady was conveyed
to the cabin, and gradually restored to
her senses. In the mean time, the captain
ordered every man to conceal himself
below, and quietly took his own
station on the cabin stair, where he
could see all that passed, without being
seen. The plan happily succeeded; the
monkey, on perceiving that the coast
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_84">84</span>
was clear, cautiously descended from
his lofty perch, and replaced the infant
on the sofa, cold, fretful, and perhaps
frightened, but in every other respect as
free from harm as when he took it up.
The captain had now a most grateful
task to perform; the babe was restored
to its mother’s arms, amidst tears and
thanks, and blessings.</p>

“The Light of all Nations.”<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the vicinity of Deal, on the south-eastern
coast of England, is a place exceedingly
dangerous to ships, called the
Godwin Sands. Many vessels have
been wrecked upon them, yet it was
thought impossible, on account of the
soft and shifting nature of the bottom, to
establish a light-house there.</p>

<p>A plan was, however, suggested, two
or three years ago, for a structure of
iron, which, we understand, has been
carried into successful effect. This consisted
of an immense hollow iron shaft,
thirty feet in diameter, and sixty-four feet
in height, forming the base. This was
sunk thirty feet deep in the sands, and
rested on a bed of limestone.</p>

<p>Upon this, a column eighty-six feet
high was raised; then came the lantern,
and above this, a statue of the queen;
this last, with the lantern, is forty feet
in height. The whole structure is one
hundred and ninety feet high.</p>

<p>The weight of the lower shaft, or base,
is one hundred and twenty tons; in the
long shaft, there is room for one hundred
men with provisions; in the top
part, near the lantern, there is room for
twenty men, whose attendance is constantly
necessary to manage the light.
This splendid beacon is called “<cite>The
light of all nations</cite>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Patrick Henry.</span>—When Patrick Henry,
who gave the first impulse to the
ball of the American revolution in Virginia,
introduced his celebrated resolution
on the Stamp Act into the House
of Burgesses of Virginia, (May, 1765,)
he exclaimed, when descanting on the
tyranny of the obnoxious act, Cæsar had
his Brutus; Charles I. his Cromwell;
and George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>——“Treason!” cried
the speaker; “treason, treason!” echoed
from every part of the house. It was
one of those trying moments which are
decisive of character. Henry faltered
not for an instant; but, rising to a loftier
attitude, and fixing on the speaker an
eye flashing with fire, continued, “<em>may
profit by their example</em>. If this be treason,
make the most of it.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">Highwayman and Sailor.</span>—One of
the Dover stages, on its way to London,
was stopped by a single highwayman,
who was informed by the coachman
that there were no passengers inside, and
only one in the basket, and he was a
sailor. The robber then proceeded to
exercise his employment on the tar.
When waked out of his sleep, Jack
demanded what he wanted; to which
the son of plunder replied, “Your money.”
“You sha’n’t have it,” said Jack.
“No!” replied the robber; “then I’ll
blow your brains out!” “Blow away,
then, you land-lubber,” said Jack, squirting
the tobacco-juice out of his mouth,
“I may as well go to London without
brains as without money;—drive on,
coachman.”</p>

little vegetation, and are very cold;

<h2>
Precocity of Frenchmen.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is interesting to remark, that most
of the more prominent leaders of the
Jacobin or Mountain party, in the French
revolution, were young men. It would
hardly seem possible that many of them
had lived long enough to have their
feelings so indurated as to be able, deliberately,
to perpetrate the atrocities of
which they were guilty. This remark
will appear more obviously just when
we reflect that most of them had previously
led an obscure provincial life, and
may be supposed to have been little hardened
by intercourse with the world.
Perhaps, however, the greater part were
actuated more by frantic enthusiasm than
deliberate malevolence.</p>

<p>Robespierre, the master-spirit of the
party, was guillotined at the age of thirty-five;
Danton, his rival, he sent to the
scaffold at the same early age. Camille
des Moulins, when asked his age by the
bloody revolutionary tribunal, gave the
blasphemous reply, “My age is that of
Jesus Christ when he suffered death,”—thirty-three
years. Chaumette, another
of the sanguinary tribe, suffered death
at the age of thirty-one. Challer, who
proposed to erect a guillotine at Lyons
for the execution of nine thousand persons
whom he had marked, was one of
the oldest, being forty-six years old at
the time he was beheaded. Fabre
D’Eglantine, the author of the celebrated
revolutionary calendar, was thirty-nine.</p>

<p>Carrier, the most infamous probably
of the whole gang, who, when at Nantes,
tied his victims together in couples, (one
of each sex,) at the rate of twenty a day,
and sunk them in the river, was only
twenty-eight years of age, at his death.
Robespierre, the younger, about the same
age.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Just, whose talents, ferocity, and
eloquence, rendered him second only to
Robespierre, was about twenty-six. Chabot,

the Capuchin friar, was thirty-five.
Marat, who really appears to have been
half madman, was, when assassinated,
forty-nine. Babeuf, who, on the fall of
Robespierre, was thought by his party to
be most worthy to succeed the dictator,
was twenty-seven when he joined the
Revolutionists. The Duc D’Orleans,
father of the present French king, was
forty at the time he was guillotined.
These were not the originators of the
revolution; but they were the leaders
of the Jacobin Clubs, or secret affiliated
societies, over which Robespierre, as dictator,
presided for two years. They
were all beheaded except Marat. Besides
these there were others, of inferior
note, equally young. The present king
of the French, then lieutenant-general
Egalite, (<em>Equality</em>,) was about nineteen.
A pretty <em>equality</em> he has made of it since.</p>

<p>Fouche (since duke of Otranto) was
about thirty.</p>

<p>But it is likewise worthy of observation
that the leading individuals of other
parties who took part in the revolution,
were generally young men, though not
by birth, talent or wealth so generally
obscure as those just mentioned. Of the
Brissotins, (so named after their leader,
Brissot de Warville, well known as
the friend of Jefferson, and a traveller in
this country, but otherwise called Girondists,)
Brissot was thirty-nine. Bailly,
the celebrated astronomer, and revolutionary
mayor of Paris, was one of the
oldest. He was beheaded, at the instigation
of Robespierre, at the age of fifty-seven,
dying with courage and dignity.
Charlotte Corday, who, although a woman,
was a Girondist, was but twenty-three
when she assassinated Marat. The
eloquent Barbaroux was about twenty-seven
when beheaded. The just and
magnanimous Barnave was executed at
the age of thirty-two. Madame Roland,
who died more as a man ought to die
than all that were guillotined, was forty.
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_87">87</span>
Gensonne, the Brissotin, who was first
to proclaim that <em>suspicion</em> was sufficient
cause for the infliction of death, was
sent to the scaffold by Robespierre at the
age of thirty-five. Mirabeau, whose
eloquence covered his crimes all over
with glory, was about forty years of age.
Cabanus was thirty-six. Buzot, thirty-three.
The most eloquent and accomplished
Vergnaud perished at the age
of thirty-five.</p>

<p>Those last mentioned were some of
the principal Brissotins. Among the
Royalists, D’Elbee, the principal Vendean
chief, was about forty. Stofflet, another
Vendean, was thirty-eight. The
Duc D’Enghein, no more than twenty.
Pichegru, in Robespierre’s time, not
more than thirty-two.</p>

<p>Among the famous generals of the
revolution, there were few who were not
comparatively boys. Hoche, who was
thought by many to be equal to Bonaparte,
died at thirty. Honchard, when
guillotined, was thirty-two. Kleber, one
of the oldest and best, was forty. Dessaix,
the knight, without fear and without
reproach, was thirty when he received
his death wound at Marengo.
Other great captains who afterwards became
renowned, Ney, Soult, Joubert,
(only twenty-five,) M’Donald, Lannes,
Duroc, Victor, Mortier, Oudinot, Murat,
Eugene, (a mere boy,) &amp;c. &amp;c., were all
young. But the giant is behind—Him!
<em>Bonaparte!</em> the little corporal was but
twenty-four.</p>

<p>Well did the Swedish chancellor, Oxenstrein,
say to his son, when he sent
him on his travels, “Go, son, and discover
what little wisdom it takes to govern
the world!”</p>

<h2>
September Thoughts.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gay, beautiful, and ever welcome
months of summer are gone, and the
months of autumn have begun to take
their place. Our summer movements
are fast closing,—our summer journeyings
are passing away,—the travelling
invalid and belle of fashion now wend
their way homeward. Our merry meetings
upon land and water, our annual
visits, our assemblies under the canopy
of heaven, our sailing excursions, our
night wanderings,—all will soon be over.
To be sure, Niagara still will thunder,
and still there will be the rushing of
mighty waters from her magnificent falls;
but her music will be music for herself
alone. The multitude who have gazed
in wonder upon this mighty work of an
Omnipotent Architect, will soon be far
distant. Saratoga, too,—that little world
of folly and of fashion, where thousands
congregate to kill time, or else, perchance,
to woo and wed,—will soon be
desolate.</p>

<p>Two months hence and the cap and
the cloak will take the place of our summer
apparel. Our summer breezes will
be changed into autumn winds. The gay
and pleasing attire of our green fields
and pleasant gardens will present the
forbidding coldness of their own peculiar
desolation. Our trees will cast off their
foliage and their fruits, and instead of the
blossom and the rose, the desert will
appear. “Thus passes the glory of the
world.” But a truce to autumn reflections.</p>

<p>September, then, has come among us.
It is the time for trade, the signal for
business, the prelude to long nights and
short days, the time for balls and parties,
the time for work, and the time for play;
the time for merchants and clerks to rise
early and retire late; the time for our
mechanics to work in the evening and
sleep in the morning; the time for wooing
and wedding; the time to prepare
for winter—to buy your fuel and make
ready for stormy days. It is the time to
make money and pay your debts, the
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_88">88</span>
time to study, and the time to make good
bargains; the time to be honest, and the
time to speak the truth; the time to
make friends, and the time to do good.
In a word, it is <em>the</em> time, <em>our</em> time, the
<em>only</em> time. To our good mothers, grandmothers,
and daughters, we say then,
improve it; and to our perpetual motion
business men, who neither sleep long nor
slumber long, our advice is not needed.
To the drones and sluggards that surround
us, we say, prepare for freezing
time and starving time, for a bed of ice
and snow, and for a beggar’s meal. To
the drunkard, we say, keep sober; and to
the sober, we say, keep the bowl from
the drunkard. Our advice is for all, and
good to all, and he, whomsoever he may
be, is a criminal who will not take it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><a id="v6P88a"></a>
<span class="smcap">Politeness.</span>—Men think very little of
the value of a bow; how small the cost
and how great the return. So, for a few
soft words and pleasant looks, interest is
paid, compound and simple added together.
How many compliments have
been lost on the one hand, and gained on
the other, from neglecting or putting into
exercise this one important thing. A nod!
Why, it has gained more friends than
wealth and learning together. A compliment,
a fine speech, a pleasant look, are
each more valuable than rubies. There
is yet another value to politeness, which
till lately the world knew but little, and
but perhaps for Louis Phillippe and Alibeau,
nothing would have been known.
It seems that the king was in the act of
bowing to the national guards, at the
moment the assassin, Alibeau, discharged
his weapon at the monarch’s head. Evidently
the king’s politeness saved him
his life.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><a id="v6P88b"></a>
<span class="smcap">Chinese Filial Piety.</span>—Ouang-Ouei-Yuen,
having lost his mother, who was
all that was dear to him, passed the three
years of mourning in a hut, and employed
himself, in his retirement, in composing
verses in honor of his mother, which are
quoted as models of sentiment and tenderness.</p>

<p>The three years of his mourning having
elapsed, he returned to his former
residence, but did not therefore forget his
filial affection.</p>

<p>His mother had always expressed
great apprehension of thunder, and when
it thundered, always requested her son
not to leave her.</p>

<p>Therefore, as soon as he heard a storm
coming on, he hastened to his mother’s
grave, saying softly to her, as if she could
hear, “I am here, mother.”</p>

Christ Healing the Sick.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> we look into the history of Bonaparte,
or Cæsar, or Alexander, we shall
see that their lives were chiefly employed
in killing people; in making war, by
which men, women and children suffered
the most dreadful agony, misery and
death.</p>

<p>It seems to be a natural idea for men
of powerful minds and great ambition,
to aim at subduing their fellow-men, and
when these resist, to kill them. And,
strange to say, the greater number a man
kills, the greater hero he is.</p>

<p>Such is the way with mankind.
How wonderful it is, then, to take up
the New Testament, and read the history
of Jesus Christ. How unlike he is, to
the great men of the earth—to the Cæsars,
the Alexanders and the Napoleons!</p>

<p>In the fourth chapter of Matthew, we
are told that, after leaving Nazareth,
Jesus began to preach repentance, and
to heal all manner of sickness and disease.
Instead of wounding and killing
mankind, he went about doing good.</p>

<p>“And his fame”—says the sacred
story,—“went throughout all Syria;
and they brought unto him all sick people
that were taken with divers diseases
and torments, and those which were
possessed with devils, and those which
were lunatic, and those which had the
palsy; and he healed them.”</p>

<p>What a wonderful—what a beautiful
story is this! Who had ever set such
an example? What <em>man</em> had ever conceived
the idea of going about doing
good? What <em>human being</em> had ever
the idea, the purpose, and the power,
of going about, curing all manner of
diseases?
</p>

<p>Surely this was unlike <em>human nature</em>,
and altogether beyond <em>human power</em>; it
was evidently a <em>divine</em> character, exercising
<em>divine</em> power. He came to save a
world which was lost; for he saw that
the “heart of man was only evil, and that
continually.” He came to atone for the
sins of mankind; to reconcile a holy
God to a sinful world.</p>

<p>The more we contemplate the character
of Jesus Christ, the more will it rise
in beauty and grandeur before our
minds. Let us form of him the most
noble and lofty conceptions, we shall
still see him towering above and beyond
them.</p>

<p>It does not require a great mind, but
only a holy heart, to see Christ in his
majesty and beauty. Thus it is that
such a man as Bonaparte, having no
just moral vision, no eye for goodness,
sees in Christ only a strange being,
whom he conceives to be bewildered with
his own fancies; while a simple-minded,
but still inspired apostle, calls him “my
Lord and my God!” See John, 20th
<abbr title="chapter">chap.</abbr>, 28th verse.</p>

<p>The difference between the worldly
spirit of selfish man, and the spirit of
Christianity, may be strikingly presented,
by selecting two pictures, and
placing them side by side. Let us take
a picture of Bonaparte, representing him
in one of the leading actions of his life—and
what do we see? He is fighting a
battle; around him are the engines of
death; blood flows on every hand;
the screams of the wounded, the agonies
of the dying, fill the air; the earth is
strewed with ghastly forms; the very
heavens are black with the smoke of the
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_92">92</span>
deadly conflict. <em>And this is human
glory! This is human nature!</em></p>

 <p class="caption"><i>Christ healing the Sick.</i></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Let us turn to another picture, that
painted by West, of which we give an
engraving; it is <cite>Christ healing the sick</cite>.
Does not every child see the difference
between <em>human glory</em> and <em>Christianity</em>;
between the things to which human
nature and human pride lead us, and
the things to which Christ would lead
us? Does not every child see the deformity
of one picture when placed by
the side of the other picture? How poor,
paltry and mean is that spirit which
sacrifices all to self! How lofty that
god-like spirit, which embraces all mankind
in its generous love of doing good!
How contemptible is the worldling!
How elevated the true Christian!</p>

Going to School.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Why</span> do children go to school—to
benefit their parents, or themselves? I
sometimes fancy that children make a
mistake in this matter, and fancy that
they go to school just because their parents
will have it so, and not because it is
important to their happiness to learn to
read, and spell, and write and cipher.</p>

<p>The fact is, that parents love their
children, and desire their happiness, and
therefore it is that they desire them to
be taught at school. Many parents are
so anxious that their children should be
well educated, that, although they are
poor, they will toil very hard to get the
means of sending them to school.</p>

<p>Children should therefore consider
that it is for their own sake they are
sent to school, and required to learn and
say their lessons. It is to make them
wiser and better, and to qualify them to
obtain success in life, that they are
thus trained up, by their parents—those
who love them best, and best know what
is good for them.</p>

The First Sailor.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> my readers have seen rafts, and
boats, and ships, and they know perfectly
well that it is very easy to sail on the
water. But who was the first sailor?
Who first ventured forth in a boat or a
vessel?</p>

<p>We are told of Noah, who floated in
an ark, thousands of years ago, and was
thus saved when all the rest of mankind
were drowned by the deluge—but no
doubt people had learned to go upon the
water before the time of Noah.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>It is thought that the nautilus, of
which we once gave a picture in the
Museum, and which is a natural sailor,
first suggested the idea of a boat or ship.
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_94">94</span>
It is probable, however, that mankind
early saw that wood would float in water,
and soon applied their observation to
practical purposes. They doubtless first
got upon logs, and then made rafts, to
sail upon. By-and-by they doubtless
built boats, and lastly ships.</p>

<p>There is a great difference between
the beginning and end of an invention.
The picture at the head of this article
shows a savage upon his raft; the next
is a view of the interior of a ship, displaying
its floors and beams and timbers.</p>

<p>The art of building ships has advanced
gradually, with the other arts of
man. Here is a picture of a ship of war
used about two thousand years ago.
How very different it is from a ship of
war of the present day! It has no deck,
but is open like a boat; while a large
ship of war of the present day, has four
stories! The ancient ship of war would
hold fifty or sixty people, while a ship
of war, now, will hold a thousand.</p>

<i>About the bees.</i><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is well worth while to attend
minutely to the business that is going
on in the bee-hive. Nothing, in a great
city, where we see houses, and streets,
and manufactures, and a vast population,
all busily engaged, can be more curious
than what is to be witnessed in the city
of the bees.</p>

<p>The queen is the mother of all the
young bees, for she lays all the eggs
from which young ones are hatched.
When she wishes to lay the eggs, she
goes to the cells which have been made
by the workers, and having taken a
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_95">95</span>
peep into them, drops in her eggs, taking
care to distribute them properly. It is
said that a single queen will lay six
thousand eggs in a single month, and
sometimes one hundred thousand in a
year!</p>

<p>The eggs are very small, of a bluish
white color, and of a long, oval shape.
They remain unchanged for four days
and are then hatched. At first, the
young bee is only a white worm or
maggot, and may be seen floating at the
bottom of the cell, in a whitish fluid,
furnished by the nursing bees. It grows
rapidly, and as it lengthens coils itself
into a ring. It is then called a grub-worm,
or larva.</p>

<p>The little worms are carefully attended
by the nurses, and as soon as these
approach and touch them, they open
their minute jaws and receive the food.
This consists of a nice kind of soft, sweet
pap, formed by the farina of flowers,
honey and water, carefully mixed, and
partly digested in the stomachs of the
nurses.</p>

<p>When Miss Betsey Piper had got to
this point, Jack spoke as follows:</p>

<p>“That’s very queer, aunt Betsey,
and very interesting; but don’t it remind
you of the story about the old Dutch
landlady, in the state of New York?”</p>

<p>“No,” said aunt Betsey.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Jack, “don’t you remember
that Mr. Roley told us about it?
He said that he was once travelling in
the western part of the state of New
York, when he came to a little brown
tavern, kept by an old Dutch woman.
It was evening, and he asked for supper.
The old lady had very little in her house
but bread and milk, and he concluded
to have some of this. ‘How do you
like it,’ said the landlady—‘mummed
or crumbed?’ Now Mr. Roley didn’t
know what <em>mummed</em> was. So, out of
curiosity, he told her he would have it
mummed. Upon this, the landlady got
a large bowl of milk, and several large
slices of bread. Then, standing over
the bowl, and taking a slice of bread, at
each end, with her fingers, she began to
bite off pieces, and, after a little chewing,
dropped them into the milk. This was
what she called <em>mummed</em> bread and
milk! I suppose she did it all for kindness,
but Mr. Roley couldn’t eat a bit
of it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said aunt Betsey, “don’t you
think the little bee-worms like the sweet
pap that is made for them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, very likely they do,” said Jack,
“for they don’t know how it is made;
besides, I have seen little infants eat
things that had been chewed for them by
the nurses; and it seems that the infant
bees are treated in the same way. Really,
the bees seem to be very rational kind of
creatures. But what makes me wonder
very much, is how they should know
anything without any books, or instruction.”</p>

<p>“That is indeed very wonderful,”
said aunt Betsey, “and we can only explain
it by referring it to that admirable
teaching of their Creator, called instinct.”
The dialogue here ceased, and
the narrator went on.</p>

<p>When the little worms are about four
or five days old, and have grown so
large and fat as to fill their cells, the
nurses seal them up with a brown cover
of a conical form. No sooner does the
larva find himself shut in, than he
begins to work up and down, and to
wind around himself fine silky threads,
which he draws in two strands from the
middle part of his under lip. Round
and round he goes, for he knows what
is to be done; nor does he stop till he
has woven about himself a thin pod or
pellicle, just the size of the cell. In
this condition, the creature is called a
<em>nymph</em> or <em>pupa</em>.</p>

<p>The working bee is about thirty-six
hours in spinning and weaving its cocoon
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_96">96</span>
or covering. It thus spends about three
days, during which a wonderful change
is going on. While in the larva state,
the creature has no tail, wings or legs;
it is a simple worm. But while it is in
its swaddling clothes, the legs and wings
are gradually formed, and, at the end
of twenty-one days from the laying of
the egg, it gnaws through its covering
and comes forth a winged insect, destined
to sport in the air and hold a joyous
revel among the flowers. As if impatient
for sport, the insect goes forth
soon after its birth, and it is said that it
may be seen returning to the hive, loaded
with wax, the same day that it became a
bee!</p>

<p>While the young bees are in the larva
state, the utmost care is taken of them.
If any member of the hive is rude or
careless toward the egg, or worm, or
the yet unhatched pupa, the nurses are
very angry. But when the pupa has
gnawed his way through his covering,
he seems to be regarded as of age, and
able to take care of himself. The tender
care of the nurse now ceases altogether;
and the working bees scramble over his
head, without scruple. While he is
still weak, and scarcely strong enough
to get out of his cell, as if for the very
purpose of making him acquainted with
the hardships of life, the rude multitude
of bees rush headlong by, often knocking
him down, and sometimes giving
him a severe poke in the side, or a
thump on his skull. How much like
human creatures the bees are!</p>

<p>I have told you how the working bee
nymphs are hatched; the complete bee
is formed in twenty-one days. The
process is nearly the same, in respect to
the queen bees and the drones; the
former, however, are hatched in sixteen
days, and the latter in twenty-five, from
the laying of the eggs. There is one
thing in respect to the royal bees, or
queens, too curious to be omitted.

When they are nearly ready to emerge
from their cells, the bees gnaw the covering
so as to make it very thin. They
then eat a small hole through it, and
feed the pupas for a few days. They
are thus kept as prisoners, and during
this time they begin to sing a faint song,
called <em>piping</em>. This is so droll, that I
can’t help writing a song, which I shall
call the</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is now October—the tenth month
in the year. It was anciently called
<em>wyn monat</em>, or wine month, because this
is the season of the vintage. An old
stanza says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Then for ‘October month’ they put</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A rude illuminated cut,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Was vintage at this time of year.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this country, we have some grapes,
but we make no wine, or very little.
With us, October is a beautiful month;
for now the green leaves of the forest
are changed and present a variety of the
most brilliant hues. The woodbine is
seen climbing up the trees and rocks, as
red as the coat of a British soldier.
The ash, the maple, the oak, the shumack,
are clothed in red, yellow, and
purple of every shade. The mountain
seems to be robed in a coat of many
colors.</p>

<p>Although winter is approaching, and
already many of the leaves are dropping
from the boughs to wither and to perish,
still the aspect of the forest is gay and
brilliant, as if nature put on her most
gorgeous garments at the very moment
when death and decay are approaching.</p>

<p>While these scenes are presented to
the eye, the farmer is busy in gathering
his crop of Indian corn, digging his potatoes,
and securing the pumpkins,
squashes, beets, and other vegetables of
the garden. The migratory birds have
departed, but the whistle of the quail is
heard at morning and evening. The
drumming of the partridge murmurs
through the forest, and the squirrel is
seen feasting upon the chestnut and walnut
trees. October is, indeed, a pleasant
month.</p>

The Island of Hong Kong.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the late war between Great Britain
and China, the former took possession
of the island of Hong Kong. They
still retain it as a station for their vessels;
and as it is likely to become a place
of some interest, we give a picture which
presents the bold and rugged aspect of
the country, and we shall now add a few
particulars descriptive of the island.</p>

<p>It lies on the coast, at the south-eastern
point of China, and near to the main
land. Its surface is very uneven, it
being broken into rugged mountains and
deep valleys. It appears like a huge
mass of earth and rock, that has been
severed from the adjacent continent and
tumbled into the sea. The loftiest peak
is said to be about fifteen hundred feet
high.</p>

<p>The view of the island which we have
presented, exhibits several tall conical
mountains, rising in the centre, and a
beautiful cascade, pouring over a high
rock into the sea. To the right may be
seen a few small huts, which, a few years
since, constituted the only habitations
upon the island. These were occupied
by a small number of miserable natives,
who lived almost entirely by fishing.</p>

<p>The island is for the most part sterile
and unpromising. It has no beasts and
few birds; scarcely a tree finds root in
its soil, and the shrubs are stunted and
dwarf-like. By the margin of the
streams, there are numerous flowers,
some of which are exceedingly beautiful.
The climate is hot, and the thermometer
sometimes rises to one hundred
and twenty degrees. This island is
chiefly valuable to the British on account
of its fine harbor, which is capable of
containing a great number of ships,
which may there rest in security.</p>

1783, he signed a treaty of peace with
England, which put an end to the wars
that his father had commenced.</p>

<p>Tippoo had now a kingdom about
twice as large as the state of New York
in extent, with an annual revenue of
$14,000,000. The country was thickly
peopled and well cultivated; but Tippoo
was a Mahometan, and he began to persecute
those who differed from him in
religious faith. He caused the Brahmins
to be cruelly beaten, and such was his
rigor towards the Christians, that seventy
thousand of them left his dominions.</p>

<p>After a time, he became again involved
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_100">100</span>
in a war with the English, and Tippoo
was besieged by Lord Cornwall, in his
capital of Seringapatam. Reduced to
extremity, he agreed to a peace, by the
terms of which he was compelled to relinquish
one half his kingdom and pay
the enormous sum of $15,000,000. This
took place in 1792.</p>

<p>Tippoo was a man of great talents
and a good deal of pride. He could not
well submit to the humiliation he had
suffered, and accordingly he again engaged
in war against the English. He
had entered into intrigues with the
French, and as Bonaparte at this time
made his famous expedition into Egypt,
it has been supposed that he expected
assistance from Tippoo in an attempt to
subjugate India and strip England of her
possessions in that quarter.</p>

<p>The British troops prosecuted the war
with vigor, and having defeated the sultan
in two pitched battles, he was obliged
to retreat to his capital. Here he was
again invested, and on the 4th of May,
1799, Seringapatam was carried by
storm. Tippoo was slain in the assault,
while bravely defending the ramparts,
and his kingdom was divided. This
monarch, though capricious and cruel,
was fond of literature, and had collected
an extensive and valuable library, which
is still preserved in the University of
Calcutta.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not our design to detail the proceedings
of the regiment raised in Saybrook,
and commanded by Colonel Joinly.
It is sufficient to say that it marched
toward New York, and crossing over the
Sound to Long Island, for the purpose of
executing some plan against a detachment
of British troops stationed there,

they were attacked by a superior force,
and after some brave fighting, were
driven back. A small portion of them,
including the colonel, being separated
from the rest, were surrounded and captured.
The rest were dispersed and
returned to their homes.</p>

<p>New York had now fallen into the
hands of the British, and General Clinton,
the British commander, had established
his head-quarters there. The
citizens, for the most part, remained at
home, though many families had departed
for other portions of the country.
Those who remained were not disturbed
in their ordinary business, though they
were carefully watched by the British
officers.</p>

<p>The city of New York at this period
seemed almost like a British town. The
soldiers of King George, dressed in their
red coats, and bearing the British flag,
were seen parading the streets every day
and filling the city with the sounds of the
fife and drum. Sir Henry Clinton had
a fine house, where he might often be
seen, surrounded by British officers gayly
decked in gold lace, rich epaulettes,
and cocked hats ornamented with
plumes.</p>

<p>Though the business of these men
was war, they seemed, while in New
York, to be chiefly occupied with amusement.
It is true, that, during the day,
they rode forth on fine horses to review
the troops, examine the fortifications, or
inspect military stores. Sometimes they
assembled together for counsel, when
they might be seen carefully inspecting
maps, reading despatches, and forming
deep schemes to defeat General Washington
and conquer our country.</p>

<p>But although a portion of their time
was thus occupied, still these officers
seemed to live as if amusement engrossed
their attention. They were often
seen gallanting gay ladies through the
streets, and almost every evening was
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_101">101</span>
devoted to pleasure. Frequent levees
were held at the general’s house, where
music, dancing and revelry seemed to
fill the hearts of all who were present.
There were several American families
in New York, who were friendly to the
British and opposed to the cause of liberty;
they were called tories. These
paid their court to General Clinton, and
did everything in their power to please,
amuse, and gratify his officers.</p>

<p>Thus things went gayly on in the city,
while war raged in all parts of the country.
Towns and villages were attacked,
the houses plundered and burned, the
inhabitants slain or driven in poverty
and desolation from their houses. Even
where these scenes of violence had not
occurred, and in places remote from battle
and bloodshed, there was sorrow
and gloom hanging over many a family
and many a village. To form an
idea of this, let us turn our attention a
moment to Saybrook and the home of
Colonel Joinly. He had now been absent
about two years, being detained in
captivity at New York. He had left
behind him a wife and family of six
children.</p>

<p>Before his departure, they had lived
in the enjoyment of wealth and prosperity.
Their house stood upon the bank
of the Connecticut river, commanding a
view of the noble bay, which spreads
out at the point where that stream mingles
with the ocean. The edifice was
of the olden fashion, of two stories, with
a steep roof and heavy cornices. It was
of ample dimensions, with several out-houses
and two large barns; the latter
showing that a liberal farm was connected
with the domain.</p>

<p>Several lofty elms stood around, and
two in front, with their vast spreading
branches, especially, indicated the full
century which had elapsed since the
house was reared. In the present instance,
they might have been emblematic
of the two heads of the house. It seldom
happens that two nobler spirits are
united than in the alliance of Captain
Joinly and his wife.</p>

<p>He was distinguished alike for manly
beauty, fine intellect, and true nobleness
of soul. Eminent in his profession, he
had acquired wealth, which had been
used to embellish his home, bestow the
advantages of education upon his family,
and dispense charity around him. His
wife was in every respect his equal.</p>

<p>I remember her well, for she lived to
the age of threescore and ten, and when
I was a boy, and sat upon her knee, she
told me the tales which I am now telling.
In her old age, her tall form was erect,
her eye black and piercing, and as she
walked upon her high-heeled shoes, she
seemed the very image of dignity. She
was still scrupulous as to her toilette;
and though she had the long waist, the
tall cap, the frizzed gray hair, the rich,
stiff, black silk of the olden time, there
was a graciousness of manner, a heavenly
sanctity of countenance about her,
which rendered her, as my memory has
preserved her portrait, one of the most
beautiful beings I have ever beheld.
There is surely no extravagance in conceiving
that the two noble elms that
stood before the old mansion, were emblematic
of the master and mistress who
presided over it.</p>

<p>For a series of years, an unbroken
tide of prosperity had seemed to attend
the Joinly family. In the enjoyment of
wealth and respectability, they also
possessed the confidence and good will
of all around. They might, perhaps, be
considered a little aristocratic, and there
was doubtless something of family pride
in their hearts.</p>

<p>But these things were common in that
day; the English custom of dividing
society into different ranks was prevalent
in the country. Where there was wealth,
talent, and good character, a certain degree
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_102">102</span>
of superiority was assumed. It did
not then, as in our day, give offence, for
such was the practice of the people; and
especially in the case of the Joinlys,
was the rank assumed on the one hand,
and accorded on the other, without provoking
unpleasant feelings. In the dignity
they maintained, there was nothing
of strutting, of haughtiness, or pride;
and such was their reputation for kindness,
hospitality and charity to all, that
envy was disarmed and scandal silenced.</p>

<p>Such was the state of things when
the hospital on Duck Island was destroyed.
This was a serious disaster; for
the amount of property that was lost was
considerable. It was, however, followed
by other calamities. Colonel Joinly expended
a large sum of money in preparing
his own outfit and that of the regiment,
all of which was speedily dissipated.
Beside this, the unfortunate
result of his expedition, though in no
respect occasioned by want of skill or
courage, had impaired the reputation of
the colonel, and served in no small degree
to mortify the feelings of the family.</p>

<p>But more than all, his prolonged captivity,
and the circumstances which
attended it, served to harass both himself
and those who were nearest and dearest to
his heart. He was detained at the western
extremity of Long Island, contiguous
to New York, where a large number of
American prisoners were kept. Some
of these were in barracks, and others in
the hulks of large vessels, which were
moored near the shore of the present
town of Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Crowded closely together in these dismal
apartments, with unwholesome and
scanty food, surrounded with a putrid
atmosphere, and deprived of every comfort,
the poor wretches suffered everything
that humanity could endure. Many
of them fell victims to these miseries, as
well as to diseases engendered by destitution,

famine, and an infectious atmosphere.—Colonel
Joinly, from his rank,
was spared these miseries; but he was a
physician, and seeing the sufferings of
these poor wretches, his generous heart
was touched with pity, and, from the first,
he devoted himself to their alleviation as
far as was in his power. He expended
the little money he possessed in the purchase
of medicines, and when this was
exhausted, he sent home to his family,
begging them to forward him all the
money in their power to be employed in
this pressing charity.</p>

<p>Though already impoverished, and
struggling under many difficulties, his
wife despatched all the money she could
collect, and added several articles of
jewelry. All this was soon expended,
and still there was a demand for more.
The colonel, at length, exchanged his
gold watch and his gold sleeve buckles
for medicines; and finally he proceeded
to some of the merchants in New York,
and ran in debt to a considerable amount
for the same object.</p>

<p>From the earliest dawn, till late at
night, he was devoted to the poor, suffering
soldiers. Sometimes an hundred of
them were prostrate with disease, and he
was the only physician. Naturally of a
kind and sympathizing nature, he felt
the sorrows of these poor creatures as if
they were his own. He not only administered
to them as a physician, but
he alleviated their sorrows in every way
that his ingenuity could suggest.</p>

<p>The soldiers looked upon him as their
only friend, and they regarded him with
an affection almost bordering upon idolatry.
In a multitude of cases, he was
called by the dying soldiers to communicate
their last words to their friends,
and a large part of his time was taken
up in writing letters of this nature.
Nothing could exceed the patience, the
gentleness, the sympathy, with which he
would sit by the bedside of the dying,
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_103">103</span>
soothing their agonies of body and softening
their mental sorrows.</p>

<p>While thus, for two long years, Colonel
Joinly was occupied in his career of
charity, his family at home had been
subjected to many privations. Everything
that could be done by a woman
was achieved by the energy, skill, and
devotion of his wife. But they had been
completely impoverished by the draining
of their resources, and nothing was left
to the support of a large and expensive
family but the farm. From this, the absolute
necessaries of life were indeed
procured, but nothing more.</p>

<p>The situation of Mrs. Joinly was, in
many respects, distressing. Her husband
was in captivity, and in circumstances
which led her to feel that his
life must soon be sacrificed to exposure,
care and anxiety. She knew the depth
of his feelings, and foresaw that unless
he were soon released from his present
condition, he would speedily wear out his
life from mere sympathy with the distress
around him. She had several sons, now
approaching manhood, who needed the
guidance of a father; and she had
daughters, who were deprived of advantages
which they once possessed, and
which a father’s presence alone could
restore.</p>

<p>With all her care, she felt too that
stern poverty was creeping upon them.
The old family carriage had been laid
aside, the sleek horses were gone, and
the plough-horse alone remained in their
stead. The ample flock of sheep had
dwindled down to some half dozen ewes.
Nothing remained of the noble dairy,
but two lean cows. The fences of the
farm were going to decay, and everything
around seemed to wear an aspect
of ruin and dilapidation.</p>

<p>Hitherto, Mrs. Joinly had supported
her adversities with firmness, or if she
had moments of weakness, they were
hidden from the view of all around, and
the tears which were shed, fell in secrecy
and silence. But at last, she wrote a
letter to her husband, setting forth her
anxieties, and begging him earnestly to
adopt some means by which he would be
able to return.</p>

<p>When this letter reached Colonel
Joinly, his heart was wrung with anguish.
It seemed impossible that he
should leave the prisoners to their fate,
and yet, the call of his family appeared
imperative. With a view of discharging
his duty to all, he proceeded to General
Clinton, and in moving terms set before
him the distresses of the prisoners, and
the necessity of provision, of medicines,
medical attendants and other comforts.
This earnestness and eloquence extorted
a promise of compliance with these
reasonable requests; but the event proved
that it was promise alone.</p>

<p>Colonel Joinly also wrote to General
Washington, entreating him to provide
for his immediate exchange. He set
before him his great sacrifices, his broken
constitution, his ruined fortunes, his distressed
family. The reply received
from the commander-in-chief was full of
kindly sympathy, but it still expressed a
belief that Colonel Joinly’s presence
with the distressed prisoners was indispensable,
and that his leaving them would
be but a dereliction of duty.</p>

<p>In a state almost bordering on despair,
his nerves already shaken by impaired
health, the colonel proceeded to General
Clinton, and besought him to grant him
leave of absence for a month, upon parole.
The request seemed to startle the general
at first, but great virtues make their
way through all hearts. Colonel Joinly’s
devotion to the prisoners had become the
theme of praise even with the enemy,
and had reached the ears of the British
commander. He therefore, after a little
hesitation, granted the request of Colonel
Joinly, taking only his word of
honor as the pledge for his return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_104">104</span>
The war-worn soldier now made preparations
to depart for his home, but,
owing to some caprice in the British
commander, or other circumstances,
which we cannot explain, at the moment
Colonel Joinly was about to depart, his
leave of absence was revoked, and sick
at heart, he was obliged to submit to the
disappointment which this event occasioned.</p>

<h2>
The Blue-Bird.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> the beginning, or early in the
month of March, in Connecticut and
Massachusetts, comes the delightful blue-bird.
“Everybody loves the blue-bird,”
says the Rev. Dr. Peabody, in his Report
on the Birds of Massachusetts. And
Mr. Wilson remarks of him, “As one
of the first messengers of spring, bringing
the charming tidings to our very
doors, he bears his own recommendation
always along with him, and meets
with a hearty welcome from everybody.”</p>

<p>The blue-bird has been so beautifully
described by other writers, and so well
known, that I shall do little else than
quote from others, and principally from
Wilson, who is perhaps unrivalled in his
description of birds.</p>

<p>He has written a poetical account of
him, which is so interesting and beautiful,
and which so few persons, especially
children, have an opportunity of reading
in his beautiful work on American Ornithology,
that I am tempted to transcribe
the whole of it for the readers of Merry’s
Museum, young and old.</p>

    <div class="verse indent2">He comes, to remind us of sunshine and pleasure!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Blue-bird, as most persons, young
and old, probably know, builds its nest
in a hole in some old tree, generally an
apple tree, unless a box is provided for
him, in which the female lays five or six
very pale blue eggs. Its song is a pleasant
warble, which everybody loves to
hear. Says Wilson, “In his motions
and general character, he has great resemblance
to the Robin Redbreast of
Britain, (meaning Great Britain,) and
had he the brown-olive of that bird,
instead of his own blue, could scarcely
be distinguished from him. Like him,
he is known to almost every child; and
shows as much confidence in man by
associating with him in summer, as the
other by his familiarity in winter. His
society is courted by the inhabitants of
the country, and few farmers neglect to
provide for him, in some suitable place,
a snug little summer-house, ready fitted
and rent free. For this, he more than
sufficiently repays them by the cheerfulness
of his song, and the multitude of
injurious insects which he daily destroys.”</p>

<p>If the young readers of Merry’s Museum
will make a small box, with a hole
in it large enough for the bird to go in
and out, and nail it up in the neighborhood
of the house, in the spring or fore
part of summer, they will be almost certain
to have either a blue-bird’s or a
wren’s nest made in it, and can examine
the eggs and young at their pleasure.</p>

<p>Last year I put up a box, for martins,
on the side of my house, but no martins
coming, a pair of blue-birds took possession
of it, and raised a brood of young
ones. This season, a box which I nailed
up near the house, has a wren’s nest
built in it, in which the female has now
(July 3d) laid two eggs. The blue-birds
have not yet occupied the martin
box, but I think they may, as it was late
last year when they made their nest in it.</p>

<p><a id="v6P105"></a><span class="smcap">Kircher.</span>—The celebrated astronomer,
Athanasius Kircher, having an acquaintance
who denied the existence of
a Supreme Being, took the following
method to convince him of his error,
upon his own principles. Expecting a
visit from him, he procured a very handsome
globe, or representation of the starry
heavens, which was placed in the corner
of the room, where it could not escape
his friend’s observation; who, when he
came, asked from whence it came, and
to whom it belonged. “Not to me,”
said Kircher, “nor was it ever made by
any person, but came here by mere
chance.” “That,” replied his skeptical
friend, “is absolutely impossible: you
surely jest.” Kircher, however, persisting
in his assertion, took occasion to
reason with his friend on his own atheistical
principles. “You will not believe,”
said he, “that this small body
originated in mere chance; and yet you
would contend that those heavenly bodies
of which it is but a faint and diminutive
resemblance, came into existence without
order or design.” Pursuing this train
of reasoning, his friend was at first confounded,
next convinced, and ultimately
joined in a cordial acknowledgement of
the absurdity of denying the existence
of a God.</p>

<h3>
Green.<br>
</h3>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all colors, green is most agreeable
to the eye. Red is bright and dazzling,
and pleases us for a moment; but how
painful would it be if the whole landscape
around us were of a bright red
color! How soon would our eyes begin
to ache! How dreadful would be the
spectacle in the heat of summer, and
during the long days of June, July, and
August! How soon would a large part
of mankind, under these circumstances,
be reduced to a state of absolute blindness!</p>

<p>If the earth were covered with yellow,
or pink, or purple, or even blue, the
effect upon the eye would be either painful
and destructive to the sight, or at
least very disagreeable. But as the
earth is covered with green a large part
of the year, and as this color is agreeable
to the eye, none of these evil consequences
are experienced.</p>

<p>How beautifully are the wisdom and
goodness of God displayed in so adjusting
the eye of man that it should
take delight in that color which prevails
in nature. If God had not been a wise
being, he would not have adapted things
to each other in this admirable manner.
If he had not been a benevolent being,
he would not have made the whole
earth like a picture, so that the eye of
man might rejoice in it. He would not
have clothed the mountain, the forest, the
hill-side, the meadow and the valley, in
that particular color which is the only
one of all others that suits the human
eye.</p>

<h2>
What is it to be Polite?<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Politeness</span> is a delicate regard to the
feelings of others. It does not consist in
civil bows, or graceful wavings of the
hand, or a courtly bearing of the body,
or in flattering speeches; it lies rather in
avoiding rude and offensive speeches, in
avoiding offensive habits, and in adopting
a general course of conduct calculated to
gratify and please those around us.</p>

<p>We sometimes see people who pretend
to be very polite; who bow and say
flattering things, and affect an air of
polish and refinement; and who are yet
haughty, and seem to say, by their airs,
“We are better than you are!” Now,
whatever these people may pretend to be,
they are not polite—they are, rather,
coarse-minded, vulgar, disagreeable, people;
they are at once ill-bred, hypocritical
and wicked. They pretend to be what
they are not; they are filled with self-conceit,
and are really desirous of wounding
the feelings of others, by making
them feel humbled in their presence.
Nothing can be more offensive than such
manners.</p>

<p>A truly polite person endeavors to put
all at ease around him. If he is learned,
in the presence of the unlettered he does
not set off his knowledge; if he is better
dressed than those around him, he does
not direct attention to this fact, but leads
to other topics of consideration; if he is
handsome, he acts as if he did not know
it; if he is of a higher station in life than
others who may be present, he still treats
all with due attention and kindness.</p>

<p>The source of politeness is the heart.
If the heart is good—if it is full of gentleness,
kindness, tenderness and grace, the
face, the hands, the form, will all unite
to express it. The manners of a person
set forth his heart; they tell tales out
of school, and let everybody look into the
bosom. If a person is always saying
malicious, ill-natured things, we know
that the heart is ill-natured and malicious.
If the countenance, has a severe, harsh,
and unkind expression, we do not doubt
that it is an index to the heart. As the
pointers of a clock show how the machinery
moves within—telling of every
revolution, down even to the ticking of
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_107">107</span>
seconds—so the manners tell the beatings
of the bosom, and show to the eye of the
skilful observer, all that is going on
there.</p>

<p>Some persons fancy that politeness implies
insincerity; they imagine that it
requires a certain degree of pretence,
flattery and gloss. This is a mistake.
Politeness, like every other virtue, may
be carried to excess, and thus become
vicious or false. Politeness never calls
upon us to sacrifice sincerity; it never
requires us to say or do or pretend what
is not true. It commands us to keep our
manners void of offence; and the best
way to do this, is to keep a heart void of
offence. If we feel pleasantly, kindly,
benevolently, we shall be very apt to
appear pleasantly, kindly, benevolently.
If by any means we have adopted a bad
habit—if we have become satirical—if
we have fallen into the practice of telling
tales of others, or exaggerating the faults
of others, or taking pleasure in telling
scandalous tales of others, the moment
we become apprized of it, we should
break off such bad habits.</p>

<p>I sometimes fancy that young people—even
some of my blue-eyed and black-eyed
friends—hardly think that they are
bound to be polite: but, let me tell you,
my dear children, that now is the very
time to begin to establish the habit of
paying attention to the feelings of others.
Let me beg of you, therefore, always—at
the table, in the street, in the parlor, at
church, with the young and the old—be
polite; by which I mean, <em>be regardful of
the feelings of others</em>.</p>

<h2>
Early Rising.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> habit of early rising is recommended
by many considerations. In the
first place, it contributes to health and
long life—it invigorates the body and the
mind, and it gives cheerfulness to the
spirits. The fresh morning air is the
best of medicines.</p>

<p>Early rising also contributes to pleasure.
There is no part of the whole
twenty-four hours so pleasing, so striking,
so wonderful, as that in which the whole
world wakes up from sleep, in which
night gives place to day, in which the
glorious fountain of life rises up as from
a sea of darkness, and fulfils the bidding
of the Almighty. God says, “Let there
be light!” and there is light.</p>

<p>The habit of early rising contributes to
thrift and success in the pursuits of life.
The mechanic, the farmer, the merchant,
or the manufacturer, who rises early in
the morning, is almost certain to be successful
in his business. This habit is
also of the utmost importance to the
student, as we shall readily see by
glancing at the lives of certain great men.</p>

<p>John Quincy Adams has been for
many years in the habit of rising at four
o’clock in the morning; and it is doubtless
owing to this practice, in a considerable
degree, that he has attained his present
eminence. He has been president of the
United States; he has been the diplomatic
representative of our government
at various foreign courts; he has been for
many years a member of congress; and
all these stations he has filled with distinguished
ability.</p>

<p>He is a profound statesman, a fine
writer, an eloquent speaker. He is one
of the most learned men that lives; and
now, at the age of almost fourscore, he
is the admiration of his countrymen, and
the wonder of the age. Wherever he
goes, the people crowd in flocks to see
him; whenever he addresses the multitude,
there is a deep and reverend
silence, broken only by acclamations of
applause. What a wonderful reputation
has this man acquired, and in a great
degree through that simple habit of early
rising which is within the reach of all!</p>

<p>Let us look to other cases, and see
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_108">108</span>
what great things have been accomplished
by early rising. Paley, who, in
the early part of his college career, led
an indolent life, was awakened one
morning at five o’clock by one of his
companions, who reproached him with
the waste of his time and of his strong
faculties of mind. Struck with the
justice of the reproach, Paley, from that
time forward, rose at five every morning.
It is easy to see how such a course contributed
to the celebrity of this great
author of the Moral Philosophy and the
Evidences of Christianity.</p>

<p>The celebrated Dr. Doddridge says,
that it is to his habit of early rising, that
the world is indebted for nearly all of his
works. Sir Thomas More always rose
at four o’clock, and wrote one of his most
famous works by thus stealing time from
his sleep.</p>

<p>The celebrated naturalist, Linnæus,
rose generally at four o’clock, and at six
he gave lectures to his scholars, which
lasted till ten. Dr. Franklin was an early
riser. Dr. Bowditch, the distinguished
mathematician, of whom every American
youth should know something, rose with
the sun in summer, and at four o’clock
in winter; and he used to remark, that
to these morning hours he was indebted
for all his mathematics. Zimmerman
always wrote several hours in the early
morning. Priestly was an early riser;
and it is to hours gained in this way that
we are indebted for many of the volumes
of Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p>Buffon, the celebrated writer on natural
history, used to bribe his servant to wake
him every morning at a certain hour, and
he says, that to the perseverance of this
man, the world is indebted for his well-known
work on natural history. We may
add to this list of great men, who have
recommended early rising by their examples,
the names of Sir Matthew Hale,
Dr. Parkhurst, Bishop Burnet, Bishop
Horne, Bishop Jewell, and many others.

<h2>
Pope Julius <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr><br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> extraordinary man was originally
a fisherman, but his uncle, Sextus <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>,
being pope, and seeing that he possessed
great talents, caused him to enter the
church, where he soon obtained distinction.
His ambition was vast, and
reaching from point to point, he at last
became pope, in 1503.</p>

<p>Although he professed to be the successor
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter, who preached the
gospel of peace, Julius did not hesitate
to raise armies and make war; and, what
is remarkable, he led his armies in person,
and in battle displayed all the fierce
courage and bold daring of the soldier.
At the siege of Mirandola, in 1511, he
exposed himself, at the head of his men,
at any point of danger: when a breach
in the walls was effected, he entered by
a scaling ladder, sword in hand, being
among the very foremost of the headlong
assailants!</p>

<p>The great mind of Julius was occupied
with many vast projects. In the first
place, he desired to restore the see of
Rome to its former power, and he made
wars, fought battles, and intrigued with
kings and princes, to effect this object.
He did a good deal, as he thought, to
strengthen the power of the popes, and
establish, not only the spiritual, but
temporal dominion of the church; but
while he was pleasing himself with the
idea of success in one direction, we shall
see that he was laying the train, in
another, by which his schemes were to be
finally exploded, and the church itself
shaken to its foundations.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_109">109</span>
<div class="figcenter">
 <img src="images/i6_109.jpg"
 alt="Pope Julius II">
 <p class="caption"><i>Pope Julius <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></i></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Julius was a lover of pleasure, and
many tales are told of his vices and immoralities.
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_110">110</span>
He was also a lover of the
fine arts—painting, sculpture, and architecture.
Of these he became a patron,
and many great artists, particularly Raphael
and Michael Angelo, flourished in
his time and under his auspices.</p>

<p>Julius did a great deal to improve and
embellish the Vatican, which is the
Pope’s palace, at Rome. This building
is still one of the wonders of the world,
and it would require a large book to describe
its hundreds of rooms, and its
treasures of art, in painting and sculpture.</p>

<p>Among other great projects, Julius
determined to build a cathedral church,
one of such majesty and splendor as was
suitable to the city of Rome, the seat of
the popes, the centre and head of that religion
which had not only pervaded the
civilized world, but claimed to be the perpetuation
and completion of God’s dealings
with man on earth. The stupendous
and admirable church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter, still
standing at Rome,—the wonder of the
world and the triumph of art,—was the
result of this grand conception.</p>

<p>Julius was a man of great energy—and
he set immediately about his darling
project. The greatest artists were employed,
and the edifice was begun on the
18th April, 1506. It was hurried forward
with such expedition, that the walls,
after they were carried to a great elevation,
cracked, and it required the wonderful
genius of Michael Angelo to devise
the means of remedying the difficulty,
and of furnishing the stupendous plans
for the final completion of the building.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s was not finished till more
than a century after both Julius and
Michael Angelo had gone down to their
graves—so vain are both ambition and
genius, in satisfying their own desires.
And as to Julius, this very work, designed,
no doubt, to hand down his name
with glory to after times, resulted in a
very different manner. His various
schemes led him into many expenses, and
in his need for money he granted the
sale of <em>indulgences</em> for sins—causing it
to be set forth that the money thus obtained,
was to build the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Peter. Julius seems to have thought it
very desirable to erect this noble church;
he, perhaps, regarded it as a very laudable
and holy enterprise, though doubtless,
some share of selfish ambition was
mingled with other feelings. And,
further, Julius seems to have thought,
for such a great and good object, that he
might deal in indulgences,—which were
pieces of paper, sold for large sums of
money, in which the pope declared that
the sins committed by persons buying
them, were remitted and forgiven of God!</p>

<p>This traffic being carried on to a great
extent, roused the famous Martin Luther
in opposition to the church of Rome, and
the result was the Reformation, by which
the power of the church of Rome was
greatly abridged, and the popes themselves
humbled. Thus the ambition of Julius
resulted in disgrace to himself, and
humiliation to the institution which he
so eagerly sought to glorify.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span>, one dark night, riding
home through a wood, had the misfortune
to strike his head against the branch

returning to the house which they had
left, about a mile distant, found the door
closed and the family retired to bed.</p>

<p>He then pawed at the door, till one
of them, hearing the noise, arose and
opened it, and to his surprise found the
horse of his friend. No sooner was the
door opened than the horse turned round,
and the man, suspecting there was something
wrong, followed the animal, who
led him directly to the spot where his
master lay on the ground in a state of
insensibility.</p>

 <p class="caption allsmcap">RICHARD DICKINSON.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> man, though deformed by nature,
as he is represented in the picture,
lived a happy life, amassed wealth, became
a great favorite with fashionable
people, and at last acquired the title of
Governor.</p>

<p>Dicky, as he was familiarly called,
lived at Scarborough, a town in Yorkshire,
England, famous for mineral waters
and sea bathing. It has long been
a fashionable resort in England, and in
paying attention to those who frequented
the place, Dicky collected considerable
money. With this, he built several public
houses, and as he was now rich, and
withal very facetious, he became quite a
noted character. The ladies patronized
him; poets sung his praises, the famous
Hysing painted his portrait, and Vertue,
no less celebrated, engraved it. A large
etching was executed, from which the
above sketch is taken, and to the likeness
the following lines were subjoined:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Behold the governor of Scarborough Spaw,</div>

<p>Dickinson received the title of governor
somewhat in mockery, but he took
it in good part. He flourished rather
more than a century ago.</p>

 <img src="images/i6_111b.jpg"
 alt="Whitney">
 <p class="caption allsmcap">JAMES WHITNEY.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> notorious person, who was executed
in 1694, for robbery, was bred a
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_112">112</span>
butcher, and it is said that his first attempt
at crime consisted in an effort to
steal a calf. He and a companion had
endeavored, in the course of a certain
morning, to purchase the calf; but as the
owner demanded an exorbitant price,
they determined to steal it the next night.</p>

<p>It happened to be very dark, but, after
some parley, Whitney agreed to enter
the stable and seize the animal, while
his companion watched without. He
entered accordingly, and began feeling
about for his prey. He soon felt something
rough, and taking it for the calf,
began tickling it, in order to make it
rise. Suddenly, the animal seemed to
get upon its hind legs, and anon grasping
Whitney with its fore paws, gave
him a most severe hug. In this posture,
he was forced to stand, lost in astonishment,
unable to move, and afraid to cry
out, lest he should alarm the inn-keeper
or some of the family; the thief without,
wondering all the time at his delay.</p>

<p>The latter, at length, putting his head
in at the door, said, “What is it that
keeps you? Are we to be all night
stealing a calf?” “A calf!” exclaimed
Whitney; “why, I believe it is the Imp
himself, for he has got his paws about
me, and keeps me so close that I can’t
stir a step.” “Pooh!” cried the other;
“what nonsense; but imp or no imp, I
should like to see him,—so make haste,
and fetch him out at once.”</p>

<p>Whitney was too much alarmed to be
pleased with this jesting tone, and immediately
rejoined, impatiently, “Oh, do be
quiet, and come to my assistance, for I
don’t half like him.” The other accordingly
entered, and after a little examination,
they discovered, to their
amazement, that they were deceived.</p>

<p>It seems that a muzzled bear, belonging
to an itinerant showman, having been
accidentally placed in the stable during
the day, the calf had been removed to
make room for him. By their joint
efforts, Whitney got relieved from the
bear’s grasp, when both made off with all
speed, half resolved never again to try
their hand at thieving, since the trade
had had so luckless a beginning.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Whitney did not mind
the warning conveyed by this ill success.
He soon after became an inn-keeper in
Hertfordshire, and connected himself
with a set of people, called <em>Gentlemen of
the road</em>. These were robbers, who
waylaid travellers, and robbed them of
their money, jewels, watches, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These desperate men were in those
days so numerous along the great roads
in England, that no persons who had
money, thought of travelling, unless
they were sufficiently armed. Many of
these robbers became distinguished for
their daring feats, and some of them
were almost as famous as Robin Hood.
Whitney, at last, became a leader among
these men, and a great many wonderful
tales were told of his dexterity, boldness,
and success. It seems that he pretended
to be a generous robber, and the following
story is told of him.</p>

<p>He once robbed a gentleman on Newmarket
heath of a large quantity of silver,
tied up in a bag. When Whitney
had got the money, the gentleman remonstrated
with him, saying, “that he
should be put to the greatest inconvenience,
if he were obliged to proceed on
his journey without money.” Upon
this, Whitney opened the mouth of the
bag, and told him to take what would
pay his expenses. The gentleman took
out as much as his two hands would
hold, to which Whitney made no objection,
only remarking, with a smile, “I
thought you would have had more conscience,
sir.”</p>

<p>Whitney pursued his career of crime,
but justice followed in his track. He
was finally betrayed by one of his companions
in iniquity, and being tried in
London, received sentence of death. In
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_113">113</span>
the presence of a vast crowd, he acknowledged
his guilt, and, at the early
age of thirty-four years, was launched
into eternity.</p>

<div class="divcenterimg60"> 
 <img src="images/i6_113.jpg"
 alt="Wolby">
 <p class="caption"><span class="allsmcap">HENRY WOLBY</span>.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> individual inherited a large estate,
was bred at the university, and
spent several years abroad in travelling.
On his return, he married a lady of great
beauty, and became in the course of
time a man of great respectability, honored
by the rich, blessed by the poor and
respected by all.</p>

<p>When he was about forty years old,
he had a dispute with his brother. He
met him one day in the fields, and the
latter snapped a pistol at him, which
happily flashed in the pan. Thinking
this was only done to frighten him, Wolby
disarmed the ruffian, put the pistol in
his pocket, and thoughtfully returned
home.</p>

<p>On examining the weapon, he found
that it was loaded with bullets. This had
such an extraordinary effect upon his
mind that he instantly determined to retire
from the world, in which resolution
he persisted to the end of his life.</p>

<p>He took a house in Grub street, London,
and selected three rooms for himself,
one for eating, one for lodging, and
the third for study. He had no attendant
but an old maid; and while his diet
was set on the table by her, he retired
into his lodging room, and into his study
while his bed was making. Out of
these chambers, from the time of his
entry into them, he never issued, till he
was carried thence, forty-four years after,
on men’s shoulders; neither in all that
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_114">114</span>
time did his son-in-law, daughter, or
grand-child, brother, sister, or kinsman,
young or old, rich or poor, of what degree
or condition, soever, look upon his
face, save the ancient maid, whose name
was Elizabeth. She only made his fire,
prepared his bed, provided his diet, and
dressed his chambers. She saw him
but seldom—never but in cases of extraordinary
necessity—and died not above
six days before him.</p>

<p>“In all the time of his retirement, he
never tasted fish or flesh. His chief food
was oatmeal gruel, but now and then in
summer he had a sallad of choice cool
herbs; and for dainties, when he would
feast himself upon a high day, he would
eat the yelk of a hen’s egg, but no part
of the white. What bread he did eat, he
cut out of the middle of the loaf, but the
crust he never tasted. His constant drink
was four shilling beer, and no other, for
he never tasted wine or strong water.
Now and then, when his stomach served,
he did eat some kind of sackers, and now
and then drank red cow’s milk, which
his maid, Elizabeth, fetched him out of
the fields warm from the cow. Nevertheless,
he kept a bountiful table for his
servants, and sufficient entertainment for
any stranger or tenant who had occasion
of business at his house. Every book
that was printed, was bought for him,
and conveyed to him; but such as related
to controversy, he always laid aside and
never read.</p>

<p>“In Christmas holidays, at Easter, and
other festivals, he had great cheer provided,
with all dishes in season, served
into his own chamber, with store of wine,
which his maid brought in. Then, after
thanks to God for his good benefits, he
would pin a clean napkin before him,
and putting on a pair of clean Holland
sleeves, which reached his elbows, cutting
up dish after dish, in order; he
would send one to one poor neighbor,
the next to another, whether it were
brawn, beef, capon, goose, &amp;c., till he
had left the table quite empty, when giving
thanks again, he laid by his linen,
and caused the cloth to be taken away;
and this he would do, at dinner and supper,
upon these days, without tasting of
anything whatsoever.</p>

<p>“When any clamored impudently at
the gate, they were not therefore immediately
relieved; but when, from his
private chamber, he spied any sick, weak,
or lame, he would presently send after
them, to comfort, cherish and strengthen
them; and not a trifle, but as much as
would relieve them for many days after.
He would moreover inquire which of his
neighbors were industrious, and had
great charge of children: and withal, if
their labor and industry could not supply
their families, to such persons he would
send, and relieve them according to their
necessities. He died, October 29, 1636,
aged eighty-four. At his death, his hair
and beard were so overgrown, that he
appeared rather like a hermit of the wilderness,
than the inhabitant of one of the
first cities in the world.”</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Voyage continued—Land discovered—Going ashore—Other
discoveries—Columbus shipwrecked—He
builds a fort.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span>, as I said, the hopes of the
seamen were for a time blasted, and they
appeared sad and dispirited, the vessels
still continued their westward course.
The weather was fine, the sea tranquil
and the wind favorable. By and by,
new indications of land cheered their
hearts. Dolphins were seen playing
about the ships, and birds of various
kinds hovered round them.</p>

<p>On the 7th of October, several on
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_115">115</span>
board the Santa Maria thought they perceived
land. This was made known to
the Nina, which being a good sailer,
stretched forward with the hope of gaining
the reward of thirty crowns. It had
been agreed that in case land was discovered
by either vessel, a flag should
be hoisted at her mast head and a gun
fired. Not long after the appearances of
land we have mentioned, the signal was
given from the Nina. But, as in former
instances, this proved a mistake, and the
high hopes which were again suddenly
excited soon vanished away.</p>

<p>To Columbus himself, it now seemed
strange that no land should be made.
They had reached a distance from home
of more than two thousand miles, and
yet the prospect was no brighter than
weeks before. At this time, he determined
to vary his course for a couple of
days south-west. He was induced to do
this by the appearance of flocks of birds
which were proceeding in that direction.</p>

<p>The prospect still continued to be encouraging,
and after the two days, Columbus
still pursued the same course.
But on the setting in of the third night,
the murmurs of the crew were loud and
threatening. Finding mild and conciliatory
language in vain, Columbus at
length assumed a tone of authority, and
declared it to be his unalterable intention
to persevere until he had attained the
object of his search.</p>

<p>On the following day, the indications
of land infused new courage into every
one’s bosom. Besides several other
things, a thorn bush, with berries on it,
was picked up; also a board and a cane.
The night at length set in. It was a
night of deep anxiety to Columbus. His
breast was alternately filled with hope
and fear. Indications of land were now
so strong that he ventured to announce
to the crews his firm belief that the time
of better things was approaching. “This
night,” said he, “I trust land will be
found.” He now ordered a double watch
on the forecastle, and promised a reward
of a doublet, or vest of velvet, in addition
to the thirty crowns, to him who should
make the important discovery.</p>

<p>That night, no one slept on board; all
was animation, all was hope; all watched
with interest the most intense. To
this general animation there was one
exception, and that one was Columbus
himself. He took a station on the top
of the cabin. He watched in silence the
progress of the vessels—a deep anxiety
pervaded his soul.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock, he was startled by
the glimmer, as he thought, of a distant
light. He hesitated—again looked—fancied
he saw it—believed that he saw
it—yet he might be deceived. In this
uncertainty, he spoke to one of the crew,
and pointed in the direction of the light,
and inquired whether he saw it. The
man declared he did. For a time it disappeared,
but again and again it was
seen by them, and at length was announced
to the crew, by several of whom
it was also descried. At two o’clock in
the morning, (October 12,) the joyful
signal was given by a gun from on board
the Pinta. A seaman first saw the land.
His name was Rodrigo de Triana.
When first discovered it was about six
miles distant.</p>

<p>Satisfied that the long-sought-for object
was found, the sails were furled, and
on the bosom of the tranquil deep, the
vessels lay in peace, and the crews, with
eager impatience, waited for the dawn
of day. That at length arrived, and
behold, outspread before them, lay a
beautiful island!</p>

<p>The feelings of Columbus I shall not
attempt to describe. It may well be
supposed that his joy was intense. The
crews were in transports. They now
thronged about Columbus. They embraced
him—solicited his forgiveness,
and told him only to command, and henceforth
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_116">116</span>
they would obey. Preparations
were now made to land and to take possession
of the country in the name of
the king and queen of Spain. This was
done with much form and solemn ceremony.</p>

<p>Columbus dressed himself in a suit of
scarlet, and as the boats, well manned
and armed, proceeded towards the shore,
he bore aloft a royal standard. On
reaching the shore, Columbus kneeled,
and audibly returned thanks to God. All
followed his example. This done, Columbus
drew his sword, and waving the
standard, declared the land to belong to
the crown of Spain. He then required
all present to take the oath of submission
to him as governor of the island.</p>

<p>From the light which Columbus had
seen the night preceding, he had concluded
that the land, whatever it was,
was inhabited. Before landing, he found
his conjectures to be true. Numerous
bodies of natives were seen running
towards the shore, and appeared to be
lost in wonder and amazement. While
the boats were getting ready, the number
of natives collected on the beach,
continued to increase. But as the Spaniards
drew towards the shore, they fled
in great terror to the woods.</p>

<p>But after the landing was effected,
finding the Spaniards quite peaceable in
their appearance, they began to venture
nearer and nearer, until at length, no
longer afraid, they came and handled the
long beards of their new visitors. They
appeared greatly to admire their dress
and the whiteness of their skins. They
looked upon the Spaniards as the inhabitants
of the skies, but they could scarcely
imagine how they descended to the
earth unless by means of the clouds, or
by the assistance of the sails of their
vessels, which they seemed to think were
wings.</p>

<p>These inhabitants were naked,—their
color was of a copper hue. They had
no beards, and the hair of their heads
was straight and coarse. They were all
painted, and in a manner which was
hideous. They appeared to be well
shaped, had fine eyes, and in their dispositions
were very gentle. Columbus
took every possible means to secure their
friendship. He distributed among them
numerous small presents, such as beads,
bells, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Having spent some time in examining
the island, Columbus made preparations
to leave it. He gave it the name of San
Salvador. By the natives it was called
Guanahani. In the maps of the present
day it goes by the name of Cat Island.
This island belongs to a cluster, known
by the name of Bahamas, of which
some say there are five hundred belonging
to the group. The southern limit
of San Salvador is in twenty-four degrees
north latitude.</p>

<p>Leaving San Salvador, Columbus proceeded
to visit several other islands lying
in the neighborhood. He found them
all inhabited by people strongly resembling
the natives of Guanahani. The
Spaniards everywhere inquired, by
signs, for gold and precious stones; but
they were uniformly given to understand,
that to find these in abundance, they
must go farther south.</p>

<p>On the 28th of October, Columbus
discovered the large island of Cuba.
The Spaniards were everywhere delighted
with the appearance of the islands.
The groves were covered with the richest
foliage; flowers of endless beauty
and variety were sending forth their fragrance
upon the surrounding air; birds
of the most brilliant plumage were sporting
on the wing; and insects of every
hue were playing in the sunbeams. All
appeared, to the weary navigators, like
an earthly paradise. Gold was now the
great object of their search. This only
was wanting, and their joy would have
been complete. But in respect to this,
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_117">117</span>
they were disappointed. Leaving Cuba,
Columbus coasted southerly, but finding
the wind unpropitious, he ordered the
vessels to return to Cuba. On the following
morning, however, the Pinta was
nowhere to be seen. What was the
meaning of this? Columbus was satisfied
that no misfortune had befallen her.
She must have deserted. But why?
Was she about to return to Spain to rob
him of the honor to which he was entitled?
At first, it was his purpose to
pursue her; but at length he thought
better of it, and proceeded to make still
farther examination of the coast of Cuba.</p>

<p>Having spent some time longer near
its shores, he stretched southward, and
soon after discovered the large island of
Hispaniola. On the coast of this, a most
unfortunate occurrence took place. On
Christmas eve, as his vessel was in a
calm and smooth sea, and proceeding
before a gentle breeze, Columbus retired
to rest. Shortly after he had lain down,
the helmsman entrusted the pilotage of
the ship to a boy, and with the rest of
the crew, was soon asleep. In the meanwhile,
the vessel fell into a current, and
before any on board were aware of the
danger, she was driving rapidly upon a
sand bank.</p>

<p>The noise of the breakers alarmed
the boy, who now called for assistance.
Columbus was soon on deck, and was
followed by the crew. A boat was got
in readiness, and the crew ordered to
carry out an anchor to a distance, with
the hope of warping the vessel into deeper
water. Too much alarmed to attend
to the directions of Columbus, the men
in the boat, instead of casting the anchor,
rowed off half a league to the
Nina for assistance. But assistance
came too late. The vessel was firmly
fixed upon the bank. All efforts to save
her were in vain.</p>

<p>Columbus and his men took refuge on
board the Nina, and on the following
day, went on shore, which was only
about a league and a half distant. Here
they were treated with great kindness
by Guacanagari, an old chief, and his
subjects, and they found considerable
quantities of gold in possession of the
Indians. The Spaniards spent some
time at this place, being at a loss what
course to adopt. The Santa Maria was
now wrecked, and the Pinta had not been
heard from. The Nina was a small
vessel, and many of her crew were fearful
that she might be lost on her return.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, and with these
fears, several of the crew begged Columbus
to allow them to remain on the
island. After a little reflection, and
finding the natives to be friendly, he
consented that a certain number should
remain. For their comfort and security,
he determined to erect a fort from the
materials furnished by the Santa Maria.
Accordingly she was broken up, conveyed
to land, and the fort commenced.</p>

<p>While this was in progress, some Indians
arrived from the eastern part of
the island, with the news that a large
vessel was in that neighborhood. This
was joyful intelligence to Columbus. It
could be no other than the Pinta. He
immediately despatched one of his men,
with several natives, to ascertain the
truth of the report. At the end of three
days, the messengers returned, but they
had obtained no intelligence to confirm
the report. Notwithstanding this, it was
still believed that the Pinta had been
seen, and some hopes were indulged that
she might yet be fallen in with.</p>

<p>The completion of the fort was now
hastened. It was called La Navidad, or
The Nativity. This being finished, Columbus
felt himself under the necessity
of discontinuing his voyage of discovery
and of returning to Spain. It might be
that the Pinta had been shipwrecked.
Sailing in an unexplored sea, amidst
islands, would greatly endanger the
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_118">118</span>
safety of the Nina. He concluded it
wise, therefore, to hasten his departure
before any accident should occur, which
might forever put it out of his power to
return, and thus conceal the important
discoveries he had made, from the sovereigns
of Spain and the people of Europe.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Hunting adventures.</i><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> time now passed without any
remarkable event. After a hunting or
war expedition, the Indian men usually
spend a large part of their time in idleness.
For several weeks after their return,
the warriors might be seen stretched
at full length in their wigwams upon the
beds of skins, and often, during the day,
upon the bare ground, basking in the
warm sunshine.</p>

<p>Thus they would repose day and night,
sleeping a part of the time, and dozing
away the rest of the hours. When hungry,
they arose and ate the meal provided
for them by the women, and then
returned to their rest. At this period,
they seemed like mere animals, such as
wolves or foxes, idly slumbering in their
caves, careless of the past, the present
and the future.</p>

<p>Once in a while these men would
rouse themselves from their indolence,
and spend a night in a wild war-dance,
or in other sports. When excited in
their amusements, they shook off their
lethargy and seemed totally changed
from the stupid beings which they appeared
to be, a few hours before. Their
black eyes would now flash with fiery
excitement; their parted lips would display
their white teeth; their long, black
hair would stream in the wind; their
hands and arms would exhibit the most
animated gestures, and their whole form
seem to be animated by intense excitement.
After the sport was over, these
warriors would relapse into the same
state of merely animal existence, as if
they had no minds, no cares, no plans,
no fears or hopes.</p>

<p>Thus some weeks passed away, but at
last, it became necessary that a supply
of food should be obtained. It is true
that some small game was obtained by
the boys, and some of the men, almost
every day. This consisted of the heath
hen, which resembles the partridge or
pheasant of the Atlantic states; black
and grey squirrels, rabbits and hares,
wild turkeys, raccoons, prairie dogs, &amp;c.
These creatures were abundant, and I
often accompanied the young Indians in
hunting them.</p>

<p>There were some guns and rifles in
the tribe, but the chief weapons were
the bow and arrow. The boys and most
of the young men had no other. It was
surprising to see with what precision and
force the arrows were thrown. I have
often seen a squirrel, perched upon the
limb of an aged tree, and being nearly a
hundred feet in air, look down as if to
laugh and jeer at the sportsman below;
when the arrow was sent from the string,
and, striking him in the head, brought him
whirling and sprawling to the ground.</p>

<p>In these hunts I took a keen delight;
and such was my enterprise and success,
that I soon became rather famous as a
hunter of the lesser game. My agility
in pursuing a wounded bird or quadruped,
and the facility with which I
threaded the tangled forests, gave me
the title of <cite>Jumping Rabbit</cite>, which long
continued to be my name.</p>

<p>In these hunts, we seldom wandered
to any great distance from the encampment,
and rarely remained out over night.
In a few instances, we were absent for
two or three days, and extended our excursions
to the distance of twenty or
thirty miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_119">119</span>
I recollect that in one of these expeditions,
we came to a considerable lake, entirely
surrounded with dense forests. It
was difficult even to peep through the
woods, for the trees stood very close together,
and the spaces between them were
choked up with dead trunks and branches,
woven and wedged together, as if the
whole constituted one fabric.</p>

<p>With a great deal of labor, creeping
and winding like serpents through the
openings, we made our way through
the forest, and came to the shores of the
lake. Accustomed, as I then was, to
nature in her wild moods, the scene that
then presented itself, greatly surprised
me. The forest that encircled the lake,
consisted, to a great extent, of lofty firs,
which stood close to the water, and
formed, around its whole border, what
seemed to be a dark green wall, rising
almost to the clouds, and thus bestowing
upon the spot an aspect of the most
perfect protection and seclusion.</p>

<p>As if won to the place by its security
and repose, myriads of aquatic birds
were there, some resting upon its bosom,
some wading in its depths, some standing
along its borders, and thousands winnowing
the air above its surface. There
were flocks of swans, with arching necks
and snowy bosoms; multitudes of pelicans,
either darting down upon their
prey, or lazily digesting their food as
they stood upon the rocks along the
shore; and wild geese, and ducks almost
without number. There was the pensive
heron, standing half leg deep in the
water, and patiently waiting to snap up
some luckless frog or fish; there was the
tall crane, with crested head, and spiteful
countenance, looking keenly into the
mud for his meal; and red flamingoes,
standing in rows that looked like files of
soldiers.</p>

<p>The scene presented the idea of a paradise
for water-birds; a spot unknown
to man, and wholly secured to the use
and behoof of its feathered tenantry.
The birds themselves seemed so to regard
it, for such were their habits of confidence,
that when we approached them,
they hardly noticed us, or moved from
us. We shot a few arrows among them,
and killed several, but this created no
general alarm. One of our party had a
rifle, and taking aim at the leader of a
long file of swans that glided upon the
water near us, he fired, and the noble
bird, uttering a faint scream, spread his
wings for flight, and fell dead upon the
surface. His companions rose heavily
from the lake, and sweeping round and
round in the air, settled again upon the
water, encircling their dead companion.</p>

<p>Loaded with game, we now set out for
our return; but this expedition was destined
to be signalized by adventures. In
our progress homeward, we had occasion
to cross a deep valley, through which a
small rivulet found its way. On the
high rocky banks of this stream our party
sat down to rest themselves for an hour or
two, and then set forward. It happened
that I had crept into the bushes and
fallen asleep; and when my companions
went away, not observing me, they left
me soundly wrapt in repose.</p>

<p>They had been gone a considerable
time when I was awoke by a noise, and
looking up, I saw a huge grisly bear
at a little distance, looking steadfastly at
me. I knew that the next moment he
would be upon me, and seizing my bow
and arrows, I sprang forward, and at a
single bound leaped over the high bank,
into the stream. It was not more than
forty feet in width—and I had hardly
crossed it, when I heard the heavy plunge
of the bear behind me. Clambering up
the opposite bank with the quickness of
a wild-cat, I seized upon the drooping
branches of a tree, and rapidly mounted
it. The fierce beast came close upon
me, and seizing the boughs with its claws
and teeth, tore them in a hundred pieces.
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_120">120</span>
By this time, however, I had ascended
beyond its reach.</p>

<p>The grisly bear is twice the size of the
common bear, and from its savage disposition
and great strength, is altogether the
most dreadful beast of the American
continent. But, happily for me, it does
not often climb trees. I therefore felt
secure. Pausing on a large limb of the
tree, I looked down at my shaggy acquaintance
below. He had now got over
his fury, and gazing in my face with a
look of the deepest interest, he seemed to
think, if he did not say—“Oh how I love
you!”</p>

<p>After sitting upon the tree for some
time, I began to grow impatient to be
released—but Bruin seemed to have no
idea of parting with me thus. He continued
for several hours, sitting upon his
rump, in a kind of brown study, but occasionally
looking at me. At last, growing
weary, I reclined against the trunk of the
tree, and my grisly jailer, as if to torment
me, lay down upon the ground, and
putting his nose to his tail, seemed to say
that he had made up his mind to stay till
I should come down. I waited for some
time in silence, to see if he would not
fall asleep and allow me an opportunity
of escape; but the moment I moved a
foot or hand, I could see his keen eye
twinkle, thus showing that the sentinel
was awake and watchful.</p>

<p>At last I got out of patience, and selecting
a good arrow, I sent it fiercely at
his head. It struck him over the eye,
and evidently gave him great pain, for
he growled terribly, and rubbed the
wounded place with his huge paw; and
finally he looked up at me, at the same
time curling his lip and showing a set
of teeth that made me shudder. I could
easily understand this pantomime, and I
knew it to mean something like this:
“Sooner or later, my lad, you must come
down, and these teeth shall take due revenge
upon you.”
</p>

<p>Night at length came—and still the
beast remained at his post. I caught a
little sleep, but I was too fearful of falling
to the ground to get any sound repose.
In the morning I heard the call
of my companions, and now knew that
they had missed me, and were come
to find me. I answered their shout with
a cry that filled the valley with echoes.
The old bear seemed startled; he rose,
shook his shaggy coat, and gazed wistfully
around.</p>

<p>Directed by my voice, my friends soon
drew near; and when they came to the
opposite bank of the river, I told them
my situation and pointed out Bruin at
the foot of the tree. In a moment the
rifle was levelled at my tormentor, and
the ball entered his side. Stung with
pain, but not mortally wounded, the
monster turned towards his new enemy.
Leaping into the stream, he began to
swim across; but his head being exposed,
several arrows were aimed at him, some
of which took effect. As he ascended the
rocky bank of the river, the rifle being
re-loaded, was again discharged, and, the
ball passing through his heart, he fell
backward, and rolled with a heavy plash
into the stream.</p>

<p>But I have wandered a little from my
track. I said that the necessity of obtaining
a supply of food, at last roused the
men of the encampment from their repose.
After making due preparation, by providing
themselves with knives, bows and
arrows, &amp;c., about twenty of them departed;
and as I was now a tolerably expert
hunter, I was permitted to accompany
the party. The events which followed,
will be described in the <a href="#v6P140">next chapter</a>.</p>

Mamma’s Lessons.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I once</span> knew two little children, who
had a great deal of knowledge, for their
age, and yet they were not taught altogether
by books. They had a good mother,
who took great pains with their
education, and she managed in such a
way as to make her lessons very pleasing.</p>

<p>I will tell you one method of teaching
which she adopted—and it was this.
She would get her two children around
her, and then would ask them what
creatures lived in the air? what lived in
the water? what lived on the earth, &amp;c.
The children would give such answers
as they pleased; if they were right,
they were told so; if wrong, they were
corrected.</p>

<p>That you may understand how this
affair went on, I will give you a dialogue,
which will set the matter clearly
before you. You will remember that the
children were named Dick and Lydia.</p>

<p><i>Mother.</i> Now tell me, my children,
what animals live in the air?</p>

<p><i>Dick.</i> Birds.
</p>

<p><abbr title="Mother"><i>M.</i></abbr> Do all birds live in the air?</p>

<p><i>Lydia.</i> No, mother; the ostrich is
said never to fly, and it seems to me
that many other birds, such as hens, partridges,
quails, and others, rarely fly,
and therefore cannot be said even to live
in the air.</p>

<p><abbr title="Mother"><i>M.</i></abbr> What birds live most in the air?</p>

<p><abbr title="Dick"><i>D.</i></abbr> I should think the swallows, for
they seem to me to be dodging about
from morning to night. And, mother, I
have heard Ben Halliard, the sailor, say
that there is a sea-swallow that is always
flying; he declares that the creature
never lights and that he hatches his eggs
under his wing!</p>

<p><abbr title="Mother"><i>M.</i></abbr> The sea-swallow, or mother Cary’s
chicken, is a bird that can remain
on the wing for a long time; but like all
other birds, it goes sometimes to the
land. It builds its nest on the uninhabited
islands of the sea; many of them
may be seen in the unfrequented rocky
islands near Florida.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lydia"><i>L.</i></abbr> Mother, it is said the birds of Paradise
live always on the wing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_122">122</span>
<abbr title="Mother"><i>M.</i></abbr> This is also an error; the sailors,
who frequented the seas near the Asiatic
islands, where these lovely birds are
often seen on the wing, fancied them to be
creatures of the air; and being always in
the spicy breath of those charming regions,
they called them <em>birds of Paradise</em>.
But now, that we are better acquainted
with the islands of the Pacific
we know that the birds of Paradise live
chiefly on the land, and sport, like others
of the feathered race, amid the branches
of the trees.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lydia"><i>L.</i></abbr> Well, mother, I think there are
other creatures that live in the air, beside
birds. I mean insects, such as butterflies,
bees, wasps, and other little
flying creatures.</p>

<p><abbr title="Mother"><i>M.</i></abbr> You should rather say, my dear,
that these animals live <em>a part of the time</em>
in the air. It is with these insects, as
with birds, that though we see them often
on the wing, they really spend but a part
of the time in flying. Let me now ask
you to tell what animals live in the water?</p>

<p><abbr title="Dick"><i>D.</i></abbr> Fishes.</p>

<p><abbr title="Lydia"><i>L.</i></abbr> Beside fishes, there are other
things; such as lobsters, crabs, oysters,
clams, and many other creatures.</p>

<p><abbr title="Dick"><i>D.</i></abbr> Yes; but these are fishes,—are
they not, mother?</p>

<p><abbr title="Mother"><i>M.</i></abbr> They are called shell-fish, but
they are quite distinct from fishes, properly
so called. The latter have no legs,
and possess fins, by which they push
themselves along in the water. They
have a long skeleton, upon which the
flesh is formed; whereas, in the shell-fish,
there is no interior skeleton, but the
flesh and muscles are attached to an exterior
shell. Thus you see that the whole
structure of the proper fishes and of the
shell fish are very distinct.</p>

<p><abbr title="Dick"><i>D.</i></abbr> That is very curious, indeed; but
there are some creatures that live partly
in water and partly on the land.</p>

<p><abbr title="Mother"><i>M.</i></abbr> Yes; and these are called amphibious.
</p>

<p><abbr title="Lydia"><i>L.</i></abbr> That puts me in mind of a story,
mother. A traveller went once to the
Tower of London, to see the wild animals.
There was a man there who
made it his business to show them and
describe them. Well, there was a young
alligator among the animals, and when
the showman came to describe him, he
said, “Here, ladies and gentlemen, is a
halligator, which came from Merriky, in
the state of Georgia; it was ketched in
the great river Mississippi, which runs
all the way up hill. This creature is
amphibious, which means that he cannot
live in the water and dies on the land;
he is six feet and a ’alf from the tip of
his tail to the tip of his nose, and seven
feet ten inches from the tip of his nose
to the tip of his tail. Like all Merrikens,
the halligator is fond of young
niggers, and the night afore he was
ketched, he made his supper upon two
of them!”</p>

<p><abbr title="Mother"><i>M.</i></abbr> That story is absurd enough;
though it is quite true that the showman
at the Tower of London, does tell some
queer stories. If he makes such mistakes
and shows such prejudice, in respect
to our country, as the story represents,
he is certainly like many English travellers,
who ought to know better. I think
Mr. Dickens, who writes such nonsense
about our country, should be employed
to show the animals at the Tower. But
let me now ask what class of animals
live entirely on the land?</p>

<p><abbr title="Lydia"><i>L.</i></abbr> Quadrupeds, or four-footed beasts.</p>

<p><abbr title="Mother"><i>M.</i></abbr> That is right; most quadrupeds
spend their time wholly on the land;
the only one of them that can fly, is the
bat; and this creature is formed almost
as much like a bird as a four-footed
beast. Some of the amphibious animals,
such as lizards, toads, frogs and tortoises,
are quadrupeds; and though these creatures
live a part of their time in the
water, most of them still spend the
greater portion of their time on the land.</p>

Old Age.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> is a picture of an old man,
walking in the woods, and a little bird,
on the tree, seems to be speaking to him.
What do you think the little bird says to
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_124">124</span>
the old man? I will try to tell you.
Thus speaks the little bird:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Come, good old man, and speak to me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For I am young and thou art old;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Full many a year hath passed o’er thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And many a tale of wisdom told.</div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Give me thy counsel, aged wight;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For here the hawk doth prowl by day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And many a cruel owl by night—</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Seeking on little birds to prey.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, tell me how these things to shun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Or teach me where to find some zone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beneath a far-off southern sun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Where hawks and owls are all unknown.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus urged, the old monk spake: “Sweet thing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I love to list thy pretty words,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And gather from thy twittering,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">That there is wisdom with the birds.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And I will give thee counsel true,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And if thou heed my word with care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In pleasures ever sweet and new,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Thy life shall pass—but, bird, beware!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Far o’er the deep an islet lone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Is circled by the briny wave;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No grief or sorrow there is known,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">No grisly death, no ghastly grave.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Depart and win with earnest flight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">This peaceful region of the blest;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But mark—a bosom fair and bright,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Alone can reach that land of rest!”</div>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Now these lines tell a fancy tale, or
allegory, which has some meaning. In
the first place, I wish my readers to observe
that the little bird does not laugh
at the old man and make fun of him, or
run away from him. On the contrary,
the bird seems to think that as the man
is old, he has a great deal of wisdom, and
is therefore capable of giving good advice.</p>

<p>Now the bird here shows good sense.
Instead of avoiding old people, children
should always love to be with them, and
should always treat them with kindness,
attention and respect. Old people are
usually very fond of children, and they
can tell them many pretty tales, and
many curious things they have seen.</p>

<p>It seems that the bird is troubled by
hawks and owls, and desires to go to
some happy land where it may be free
from such dangers, and may dwell in
quiet and content. And the old man
tells the bird, of a far-off isle, where
those who are pure and good may live
forever in a state of unbroken felicity.
This part of the allegory means that
there is a another world, in which the
pure in heart may see God and dwell
with Him forever in happiness.

The Sun, Moon and Stars.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> is a picture which represents
the earth in the centre, and the sun,
moon and stars around it. It also represents
clouds around the earth.</p>

<p>We suppose that all our readers know
that the earth is a vast globe, or ball,
eight thousand miles in diameter and
twenty-five thousand miles in circumference.
It is suspended in space, and
makes a vast circuit around the sun,
every year. It also turns round on its
axis once in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Some people cannot conceive that the
earth turns round every day, and I know
of a man who insists that it is impossible.
“Why,” says he, “if the earth was to
turn round, my well would be bottom
upwards, and all the water would run
out!” The fact that the earth revolves
like a wheel, is just as certain as that
there is a sun or a moon.</p>

<p>In the picture, the sun appears very
near to the earth; but this is only to
show how the sun shines on the earth.
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_125">125</span>
The sun is actually ninety-five millions
of miles from the earth. The moon is
also a great many thousand miles from
the earth. The stars are likewise very
distant, some of them being much farther
off than the sun.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>The science of the heavenly bodies is
called astronomy; and a very interesting
study it is. It tells us the size, the distance,
and the motions of the sun, moon
and stars, as far as we can learn them.
In the study of the stars, a telescope is
used, which enables us to see a great
many more stars than are visible to the
naked eye; it also enables you to see
little moons around some of the planets,
such as Jupiter and Saturn; it also enables
you to see a bright ring around
Saturn.</p>

<p>By the study of the heavens, wise and
learned men have come to the opinion
that all these bright orbs which you see
in the sky at night, are worlds, covered
with people, like our own world. They
suppose that, to the people in these stars,
our world looks like a little bright star.
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_126">126</span>
What a great subject of contemplation is
this! And how mighty and glorious
must be that Being who has created, and
who sustains so many worlds, with all
the living beings that dwell upon them!</p>

<i>Many curious things about bees.</i><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have already told so much about
bees, that our young readers are perhaps
weary of the subject; but it must be remembered
that we are relating the story
of Inquisitive Jack, and it is proper that
we should give a full account of whatever
interested him.</p>

<p>It happened in his case, as it has in
many others, that the more he knew
about this subject, the more interesting it
became to him. When he first noticed
the bees, crawling about the flowers, and
fingering the little delicate leaves in the
centre of the blossoms, he did not think
much about them; but now that he had
become acquainted with the wonders of
the bee-hive, he was very curious to gain
all the knowledge he could upon the
subject. By his own inquiries, therefore,
and the help of aunt Betsey, he
learned the following additional particulars
respecting these curious insects.</p>

<p>After the swarming season is over, a
general massacre of the drones in the hive
takes place. This usually occurs toward
the latter part of July. The unfortunate
victims evidently perceive their danger;
for they are now seen darting in and out
of the hive, and passing from one place
to another, as if afraid of being seized.
Like some poor man, who owes a debt
he cannot pay, and is afraid of being
caught by the sheriff, they wander from
place to place, as if in a constant state of
alarm.</p>

<p>When the working bees meet these
drones, they fall upon them and plunge
their stings into their bodies. The
wounded drones immediately expand
their wings and expire. Some of these
poor creatures struggle hard for life, but
they are all slain at last.</p>

<p>This destruction of the drones may
remind us of the old Spartans of Greece,
who sacrificed everything to the thrift
and prosperity of the state. The bee-hive
may be considered a little monarchy,
in which the great object is to increase
the number and wealth of the community.</p>

<p>The drones having provided for the
due increase of the bees, can no farther
contribute to the prosperity of the little
nation. On the contrary, they will not
work even so much as to obtain their
own food; they still devour a portion of
honey, and thus diminish the general
stock which is laid up as a provision
against the coming winter. Making
everything give way, therefore, to the
interest of the community at large, the
drones are slain without mercy.</p>

<p>This practice of the bees has furnished
a happy illustration to the poet, who thus
urges upon mankind a life of industry:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Nor think a life of toil severe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No life has blessings so sincere:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Its meals so luscious, sleep so sweet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such vigorous limbs, such health complete;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No mind so active, brisk and gay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As his who toils the livelong day.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A life of sloth drags hardly on;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Suns set too late and rise too soon.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Youth, manhood, age, all linger slow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To him who nothing has to do.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The drone, a nuisance to the hive,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stays, but can scarce be said to live;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And well the bees, those judges wise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Plague, chase and sting him till he dies.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The swarming of bees may be compared
to the emigration of a great number
of people from one country, and
forming colonies in another. In the
winter, at least three-fourths of the bees
in the hive usually perish. But the
amazing fruitfulness of the queen more
than supplies this waste, and by midsummer,
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_127">127</span>
the hive is usually too full for
them all to be comfortable.</p>

<p>It is in somewhat the same situation
that Ireland is in at the present time—and
as many of the natives of that island
are coming in swarms to this country,
so the bees pass off in crowds, and take
up their abode elsewhere. Sometimes
two or even three swarms will issue from
one hive in a year.</p>

<p>The swarm is very careful to select a
good fair day for their emigration. They
usually take one of the young queens
with them, and, if by any chance the
swarm passes off without a queen, they
always return to the hive. While
swarming, bees are generally peaceable,
and may be hived without difficulty.</p>

<p>A writer upon bees tells the following
interesting story: “A little girl of my
acquaintance was greatly afraid of bees,
but was completely cured of her fears by
the following incident. A swarm having
come off, I observed the queen alight by
herself at some distance from the hive;
I immediately called my little friend that
I might shew her the queen. She wished
to see her more nearly; so, after having
caused her to put on her gloves, I gave
the queen into her hand.</p>

<p>“We were in an instant surrounded by
the whole swarm. In this emergency,
I encouraged the girl to be steady, bidding
her remain silent and fear nothing.
I then made her stretch out her right
hand which held the queen, and covered
her neck and shoulders with a very thin
handkerchief. The swarm soon fixed
upon her hand, and hung from it, as
from the branch of a tree. The little
girl was delighted above measure at this
novel sight, and so entirely freed from
all her fears that she bade me uncover
her face. At length, I brought a hive,
and shaking the swarm from the child’s
hand, it was lodged in safety, without
inflicting a single wound.”</p>

<p>Bees are subject to several diseases;
among which vertigo is the most remarkable.
This causes great lassitude
or weakness of the hind legs, an irregular
mode of flying, and often produces
death. The enemies of bees are numerous,
among which we may mention birds,
poultry, mice, wax-moths, slugs, hornets,
wasps, ants and spiders. Of all these,
the most destructive are wasps; these
often enter the hive, and as one wasp is a
match for three bees, they devour great
quantities of honey.</p>

<p>Another great enemy to bees is the
king-bird, or tyrant fly-catcher. A gentleman
once shot a king-bird, and in his
crop he found no less than one hundred
and seventy-one bees; on being taken
out, and laid on a blanket in the sun,
fifty-four of these returned to life.</p>

<p>Great attention has been paid to the
rearing of bees, and it has been found
advantageous to remove them from one
place to another, so that they may obtain
fresh pasturage. A gentleman in England
had once a swarm which weighed
but five pounds when he removed it to
Dartmoor Heath; at the end of two
months, it was increased in weight no
less than twenty-four pounds!</p>

<p>Bees are supposed to have some means
of communicating with each other, not
very unlike language. Their two horns
which come out from the head below the
eyes, called antennæ, are supposed to
answer the purpose of ears, and to convey
sounds as well as to accomplish
some other objects.</p>

<p>Bees, as well as ants, are often seen to
meet and cross their antennæ, and they
then proceed to act as if important information
was thus imparted. When the
queen of a hive is lost, the intelligence is
spread with such rapidity that twenty
thousand bees are informed of the fact in
the space of a few hours,—a circumstance
to be explained only by the supposition
of something like language, in use among
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_128">128</span>
The lives of most insects are extremely
brief. Some live but a few hours; others
for a few days, or weeks, or months. By
far the larger portion begin and end their
existence in the course of the warm
season. The drones or male bees are
cut off by violence, as we have seen, after
having lived three or four months. The
average life of the working bee is about
six months, though they sometimes live
to the age of ten or twelve months.</p>

<p>The queen is a more favored being.
She is not only the mother of thousands,
but she survives, while many generations
pass away. Her life is often extended to
the period of four or five years.</p>

<h2>
What is Habit?<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we have done a thing several
times, it becomes easier for us to do it
than before. When a boy begins to use
profane words, he does it with a feeling
of awkwardness. The first time he
swears, he usually feels quite badly.</p>

<p>But he swears the second time more
easily, and more easily still the third
time. At last he does it without any
bad feeling, and, indeed, takes a pleasure
in his profanity. He has now got
a <em>habit</em> of swearing, and it is easier for
him to use bad language than any other.</p>

<p>It is just the same with lying. A
child feels very badly when he tells the
first lie. He feels badly, too, when he
tells the second; but when he has told a
dozen or two, he usually tells a lie as
easily as he tells the truth; and the reason
is that he has got a <em>habit</em> of lying.</p>

<p>Habit is, then, a disposition, an inclination
to do a thing, arising from practice.
It is said that practice makes perfect; by
which it is meant that a person does a
thing easily which he has done often.</p>

<p>Now some very important inferences
are to be drawn from this. If a person
does evil repeatedly, he gets a habit of
it, and it becomes natural, easy for him
to do evil; and the longer a person goes
on in this habit, the more easy it is for
him to do evil, and the more difficult to
do well. What a fearful thing it is,
therefore, to get any bad habit!</p>

<p>It is the same with good habits as bad
ones—they tend to control us and guide
our conduct. If a person does good repeatedly,
it becomes a habit with him to
do good; it is easy for him to do good,
and difficult to do wrong. What an important
thing it is to have good habits!</p>

<p>Now, my dear reader, remember that
every day you are forming habits, good
or bad; you are every day making it
easier to do evil or to do well. Habits
are like railroad tracks, upon which we
move quickly, easily, and rapidly. Let
us all take care that our habits lead in
a right direction, and end in peace and
not in sorrow.</p>

A long Chapter upon November.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have reached November, the eleventh
month in the year. Our Saxon ancestors
called October <em>wyn-monat</em>, or wine
month, and this <em>wynt-monat</em>, or wind
month. It is indeed a blustering season;
and it seems as if winter and summer
were in a furious contest for mastery.
The cold winds come down from the
north, loaded with sleet and hail, and
for a time seem to exercise dominion
over the land.</p>

<p>The tempest roars in the forest; nuts
are shaken down from the trees; the
leaves are scattered in the valley; the
ocean is lashed into foam; all nature
appears to be shadowed with gloom; and
every living thing seems to shrink from
the scene. The birds have already departed,
or if any linger, they hurry away
on a swift and busy wing. The woodchuck,
the dormouse, and the chip-squirrel
creep into their holes, and prepare
for their long winter repose.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the black clouds are
driven back, and gleams of sunshine
creep over the land. A southerly wind,
too, occasionally breathes upon us, and
it seems as if the genial warmth of autumn
would triumph in the great contest
of nature. But, as the days advance,
the strength of winter increases, and we
slide into December, when its dominion
becomes complete. Like an unrelenting
despot, it then binds the river and the
lake in icy chains; it sweeps away the
last vestige of summer, and marks the
boundaries of its realm with a dazzling
mantle of snow.</p>

<p>Such is November in New England.
In Old England, it is still more gloomy.
The thick fogs, mingling with the smoke,
hang like a dark curtain over the country;
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_130">130</span>
the day is dwindled to the length
of seven or eight hours, and the sun
rises but a few degrees in the horizon.
It is quite common for it to be so dark
that lamps and candles are burnt in the
houses during the whole day, and frequently
the stage-coaches have been
obliged at the same time to travel with
their lamps lighted.</p>

<p>This gloom of nature is, however, not
without its advantages. The necessity
of providing for winter is taught by it to
every one. The farmer lays in his stock
of fuel; the house is made tight; the
cattle are gathered to the barn-yard, and
thus the necessities of life enforce upon
the people industry, prudence, and frugality;
and these virtues become established
in society. Thus it is that in
cold countries the people, benefitted by
the rigors of their climate, become more
hardy, energetic, and virtuous. Thus it
is, if you travel over the world, you will
find in northern countries the finest
houses, the best roads, the handsomest
edifices, and, indeed, the greatest comforts
and luxuries of life. On the contrary,
if you travel in southern countries, where
winter brings no snow, and where even
November is a month of flowers, you
will find most of the people idle, careless,
and vicious. Their houses are
generally frail and poor; their clothing
slight, filthy, and ragged. Everything
seems marked with poverty and neglect.</p>

<p>So it is that Providence balances the
account with the different portions of the
globe. Those who endure a harsh climate
are compensated by the comforts
and refinements which spring up in the
soil of necessity. Those who enjoy a
bland and smiling climate pay for it in
various evils, social, mental, and moral.</p>

<p>There is one advantage which the cold
season brings, and which we of New
England enjoy in a peculiar manner.
As winter approaches, we are driven into
the house, and are taught to find our
pleasures there. The family circle is
thus drawn closer together, and hence
acquires a deeper and more lasting interest.</p>

<p>If children could always wander
abroad, chasing butterflies, plucking
flowers, and feasting upon fruits, they
would feel little of that dependence upon
parents, which is the source of many
virtues. Brothers and sisters would experience
little of that interchange of
kindly offices and friendly feelings, which
weave their hearts together with an enduring
web of affection. Home would
lose more than half its charms, nearly
all its thousand streams of virtue and
of bliss.</p>

<p>As I am quite aware that some of my
black-eyed, blue-eyed, and gray-eyed
readers are pretty sharp critics, and understand
geography, I must qualify these
remarks. In speaking of cold countries
here, I have alluded particularly to those
which belong to what is called the Temperate
Zone; those which lie between
the burning tropics and the frigid regions
toward the poles. I know that the latter
are occupied by short and squalid races
of Laplanders, Esquimaux, and Samoides.
The extreme winter in these
regions seems to stint and degrade the
human species.</p>

<p>Yet these polar people believe they
are the happiest in the world. Sheltered
in their icy dwellings, feasting upon
blubber oil, and skimming over the vast
snowy plains upon sledges drawn by
dogs or reindeer, they deem themselves
blessed above the rest of mankind. They
probably enjoy their existence quite as
much as do the languid and voluptuous
inhabitants of the tropics.</p>

<h2>
Pierre Ramus.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pierre de la Ramée</span>, more generally
known by the name of Ramus, was born
in 1515, in a village in Normandy. His
parents were of the poorest rank; his
grandfather being a charbonnier, a calling
similar to that of our coalheaver, and his
father a laborer. Poverty being his consequent
inheritance, Ramus was early
left to his own resources; no sooner,
therefore, had he attained the age of eight
years, than he repaired to Paris. The difficulty
he found there of obtaining common
subsistence soon obliged him to return
home: another attempt, which he
afterwards made, met with no better
success.</p>

<p>Early imbued with a strong love and
desire for learning, he suffered every
misery and privation, in order to obtain
the means necessary for its acquirement.
Having received a limited aid from one
of his uncles, he, for a third time, set out
for Paris, where, immediately on his arrival,
he entered the college of Navarre
in the capacity of valet; during the day
fulfilling every menial task, but devoting
his nights to his dear and absorbing
study.</p>

<p>This extreme perseverance and application,
regardless of difficulties, obtained
its consequent reward. Being admitted
to the degree of master of arts, which he
received with all its accompanying scholastic
honors, he was enabled to devote
himself with more intensity to study. By
the opinions which he promulgated, in
the form of a thesis, respecting the philosophy
of Aristotle,—a doubt of whose
sovereign authority at that time was considered
a profane and audacious sacrilege,—he
attracted the attention of the
scholars of the time, and ultimately their
enmity. With the uncompromising hardihood
of his character, he continued to
deny the infallibility of the favorite code
of philosophy, and published, in support
of his opinions, two volumes of criticisms
upon Aristotle’s works.</p>

<p>Ramus was at first persecuted merely
with scholastic virulence, but, on his further
irritating his opponents, a serious
accusation was brought against him, before
the Parliament of Paris; and to
such lengths had the matter gone as to
call for the mediation of Francis the
First.</p>

<p>Ramus was found guilty, and sentenced,
in 1543, to vacate his professorship,
and his works were interdicted
throughout the kingdom. This severe
sentence, however, did not produce the
effect desired by the Sorbonne; for, in
the following year, he was appointed to
a professorship in the college of Presles,
and, in 1551, received the further appointment
of royal professor of philosophy
and rhetoric. His opinions had,
however, attracted the attention and enmity
of a more powerful body than that
of the Sorbonne. To contest the infallibility
of Aristotle, at the same time that
it attacked scholastic prejudices, was sufficient
to provoke a revolution even in
theology. The consequence to Ramus
was implacable hatred from the ecclesiastical
body, who seemed intent upon
his destruction.</p>

<p>One of the great subjects of reform
attempted by Ramus, and which created
the greatest animosity against him, was
that which had for its object the introduction
of a democratical government
into the church. He pretended that the
consistories alone ought to prepare all
questions of doctrine, and submit them
to the judgment of the faithful. The
people, according to his tenets, possessed
in themselves the right of choosing their
ministers, of excommunication, and absolution.</p>

 <img src="images/i6_132.jpg"
 alt="Peter Ramus">
 <p class="caption"><i>Peter Ramus.</i></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The persecution of Ramus was carried
to such an extent, that, according to Bayle,
he was obliged to conceal himself. At
the king’s instigation, he for some time
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_133">133</span>
secreted himself at Fontainbleau, where,
by the aid of the works he found in the
royal library, he was enabled to prosecute
his geometrical and astronomical
studies. On his residence there being
discovered, he successively concealed
himself in different places, thinking by
that means to evade his relentless persecutors.
During his absence, his library
at Presles was given up to public pillage.</p>

<p>On the proclamation of peace, in the
year 1563, between Charles the Ninth
and the Protestants, Ramus returned to
his professorship, devoting himself principally
to the teaching of mathematics.
On the breaking out of the second civil
war, in 1567, he was again obliged to
quit Paris, and seek protection in the
Huguenot camp, where he remained until
the battle of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Denis. A few months
after this, on peace being again proclaimed,
he once more returned to his
professorial duties; but, foreseeing the
inevitable approach of another war, and
fearing the consequent result, he sued
for the king’s permission of absence,
under the plea of visiting the German
academies, which being granted, he retired
to Germany, in 1568, where he
was received with every demonstration
of honor. Ramus returned to France
on the conclusion of the third war, in
1571, and perished in the massacre of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew, as related by Moreri
in the following <span class="lock">words:—</span></p>

<p>“Ramus having concealed himself
during the tumult of the massacre, he
was discovered by the assassins sent by
Charpentier, his competitor. After having
paid a large sum of money, in the
hopes of bribing his assassins to preserve
his life, he was severely wounded, and
thrown from the window into the court
beneath. Partly in consequence of the
wounds received and the effects of the
fall, his bowels protruded. The scholars,
encouraged by the presence of their professors,
no sooner saw this, than they
tore them from the body, and scattered
them in the street, along which they
dragged the body, beating it with rods,
by way of contempt.”</p>

<p>Such was the horrid death of one of
the most estimable men that ever lived.
The private life of Ramus was most irreproachable.
Entirely devoting himself
to study and research, he refused the
most lucrative preferments, choosing
rather the situation of professor at the
college of Presles. His temperance was
exemplary: except a little bouilli, he ate
little else for dinner. For twenty years
he had not tasted wine, and afterwards,
when he partook of it, it was by the order
of his physicians. His bed was of
straw; he rose early, and studied late;
he was never known to foster an evil
passion of any kind: he possessed the
greatest firmness under misfortune. His
only reproach was his obstinacy; but every
man who is strongly attached to his
convictions is subject to this reproach.</p>

A Revolutionary Story.<br>

<p class="center smaller">
[Continued from <a href="#v6Page_104">page 104</a>.]<br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have related the bitter disappointment
experienced by Colonel Joinly, at
being deprived of the means of release
from his captivity, and of even obtaining
a short respite for the purpose of visiting
his family; nor was his sorrow mitigated
by any propitious event. Time rolled
on, and the evils of his condition seemed
rather to increase. The number of the
prisoners had accumulated, and their
miseries were aggravated by all the possible
horrors of the prison house;—unhealthy
provisions, foul apartments, and
loathsome atmosphere, attended by disease
and death.</p>

<p>His own elastic constitution was also
rapidly bending beneath his various
cares, his incessant labors, the impurities
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_134">134</span>
which he breathed, the scenes he witnessed,
and gnawing anxieties for his
family and his home. At last, in one
of his fits of depression, he poured out
his whole soul in a letter to his wife.
When she received it, it sank into her
inmost soul. Accustomed, however, to
confine her cares and anxieties to her
own breast, she did not impart the substance
of her letter to her already depressed
and anxious children.</p>

<p>She revolved the subject, however,
deeply in her own mind; yet what could
she, a woman, do? Even could she devise
the means of escape for her husband,
she knew him too well to believe that
he would take advantage of it. She
knew his chivalrous pride; his deep sense
of duty; his devotion to the cause of
his country and of humanity; and she
believed that these mingled feelings
would unite to keep him at his post until
some arrangement could be made to supply
his place, and provide for the miserable
sufferers whose only comfort he
seemed to be.</p>

<p>We may not say that there was no
momentary repining, no rebel suggestions
of the heart against the ways of
Providence, in these stern events. There
were moments when she felt it impossible
to be passive. Again and again, in
the solitude of her chamber, with clenched
hand and flashing eye, she said, “I
must do something—I must do something.”
It is often easier to rush into
some headlong enterprise than to submit
with patient dignity to the dark, uncertain
course of time; to bow with resignation
to the will of Heaven, saying,
“Thy will be done.”</p>

<p>This beautiful and lofty heroism is
however no uncommon grace of woman;
and Madam Joinly, after the storm of
feeling and affection had subsided into a
calm, sat down and wrote a cheering,
submissive, and consolatory letter to her
husband. When she had nearly completed
it, she left it, marked with her
tears, upon the table in the library, and
went out of the room, intending soon to
return.</p>

<p>She was, however, detained; and during
her absence, her eldest son, whose
name was Worthington, came accidentally
into the room. His eye fell upon
the two letters, and he hastily ran them
over. He had known something before
of his father’s anxiety and his mother’s
sorrow, but the whole force of their distress
was now for the first time unfolded
to him. He was a youth of quick perception,
great self-dependence, and firm
resolution. Saying nothing to any member
of the family, and treasuring the
knowledge he had acquired in his own
heart, he strode rapidly down to the river,
leaped into a light boat, and pushed off
from the shore. Applying the oars, he
bent them with his vigorous strokes,
and the little shallop glided out like an
arrow upon the broad water of the
sound.</p>

<p>The sea was smooth, and young Joinly,
as if he could now breathe freely,
drew in his oars, and permitted the boat
to float at the will of the waves. He
then gave himself up to thought. The
resolution to do something was speedily
fixed; but what should he attempt?
Should he go to General Washington, and
beg for his interference? Should he
proceed to New York, and throw himself
at the feet of the British general, and solicit
the liberation of his parent? Should
he proceed to the scene of his father’s
captivity, and devise the means of his
escape?</p>

<p>These suggestions were, one after
another, considered and rejected, partly
as likely to prove ineffectual, but more,
perhaps, because they did not recommend
themselves to the young man’s somewhat
bold and daring humor. He was,
indeed, wrought up to such a pitch of
excitement, that his heart found relief in
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_135">135</span>
contemplating the most hazardous enterprises.</p>

<p>While he was ruminating over his
plans, a vessel from the eastward hove
in sight. As her tall masts and snowy
canvass rose to view over the bending
water, the British flag became visible,
and young Joinly soon discovered that
she was a British frigate of considerable
size. With a slow and stealing progress,
she advanced directly toward his position.
He waited till she was within the
distance of two or three miles, when he
applied his oar and swept up toward the
mouth of the river.</p>

<p>After a short space, he paused and bent
his eye upon the frigate, now at no great
distance. He was well-skilled in marine
affairs, and his practised eye soon perceived
that it was the very ship which,
several years before, had destroyed the
hospital on Duck Island. His mind
turning upon this event, the captivity of
his father, and the desolation of the
whole country, and all proceeding from
one source—British power—he fixed his
eyes sternly upon the flag of the ship
before him, and stretching forth his
clenched fist, and uttering a curse which
we will not repeat, he shook it in impotent
defiance.</p>

<p>At this instant, he saw a mass of white
smoke unfold itself from the side of the
ship; a few seconds afterwards he heard
the report of a cannon, and, nearly at the
same moment, the ball dipped in the water
at the distance of a hundred yards
from the boat, sending the white spray
high into the air. It rose, slightly glanced
forward, seeming to utter a growling
sound as it passed on, struck the boat at
the edge of the water, and dashed it into
a thousand pieces.</p>

<h3>
<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="Four"><span class="allsmcap">IV.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>

<p>The youth found himself suddenly
sprawling in the water, but he was entirely
unhurt. Preserving his presence
of mind, he rose after the first dip upon
the surface, and said, half audibly, “That
was a good shot, old bull.” He then applied
his sinewy arms to the wave, and,
though he was two miles from the shore,
soon reached it in safety.</p>

<p>For two or three days, young Joinly
was noticed by his mother to be taciturn,
thoughtful, and frequently absent-minded.
Several times she remarked that
his brow was contracted, and that there
was an expression of unwonted sternness
upon his countenance. “What is
the matter, Worthington?” said she, one
evening, as he sat in the midst of the
family group; “why is it that you always
are making up faces, as if you
were going to turn Bluebeard?”</p>

<p>“Do I make up faces, mother?” said
the youth, a little startled. “Indeed, I
was not aware of it. I suppose I am
thinking of these rascally British.”</p>

<p>“And what have they done?” said
the mother.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Worthington, smiling,
“they have spoiled my boat.” He then
proceeded to relate the accident we have
already described.</p>

<p>Though the danger had been passed
for several days, the youth’s graphic description
of the perilous adventure drove
the color from the cheeks of the sisters,
and made even the firmer heart of the
mother beat with unwonted excitement.</p>

<p>“Oh, my son,” said she, when he had
finished, “why will you be constantly
involving yourself in such dangers?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, mother, it was no fault of
mine. You seem to be blaming me for
the misdemeanor of his Majesty’s ship
of the line; but really the thing was so
well done that I can hardly find it in my
heart to be out of humor. I am really
suspicious that they had a Yankee gunner
aboard. A lubberly British tar could
never have taken so straight an aim.”</p>

<p>“I do not like to hear you talk so
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_136">136</span>
lightly of the matter,” said Mrs. Joinly.
“Your own life has been in imminent
hazard, and it appears to me that more
serious thought is due to such a circumstance;
and, beside, I cannot but reflect
upon the fearful state of things around
us. In wanton sport, these British officers
fire upon a human being as a sportsman
shoots at a woodcock or a partridge.
How horrible is war, which thus perverts
the manners and feelings of mankind;
that converts murder into sport, sets aside
the great commandment, ‘Thou shalt
not kill,’ and makes bloodshed and
slaughter a kind of chase, in which the
amusement is proportioned to the number
and value of the game.”</p>

<p>The young man made no reply. He
sat musing for some time, and then, rising
somewhat abruptly, he retired to his
own room.</p>

<p>In the morning, Mrs. Joinly found
upon her table a note from her son, saying
that he was to be absent for a few
days upon an expedition of importance.
It entered into no explanations or details,
and the mother was left to conjecture
the cause of the young man’s absence.
We must now follow him in his adventures.</p>

<p>Since young Joinly had read his father’s
letter and his mother’s reply, he
had resolved to make some effort for the
release of the former. He had considered
a great variety of schemes, but they
were all dismissed, from one consideration
or other. The accident which had
occurred to him in the boat presented a
new suggestion. The identical ship
which had been the instrument of destroying
the houses upon Duck Island
was proceeding toward New York.</p>

<p>The desire of revenge for that calamity,
which had been followed by so many
disasters to his family, naturally arose
in his heart. This was quickened by
the wanton attack upon his little boat,
and his mind was nearly resolved upon
some attempt to seize upon the commander
and destroy his vessel, thus taking
an officer of equal rank with his father,
and having the means of securing an
exchange for his parent, at the same time
that he would inflict a merited retribution
upon the enemy.</p>

<p>This scheme, wild and extravagant as
it might seem, did not appear impossible
to the heated fancy of the youth, particularly
as he felt a perfect willingness to
sacrifice his life in the undertaking. It
was at the moment that he was half resolved
upon this mad scheme that the
conversation with his mother had taken
place. Her solemn words impressed
him deeply. He retired to his room,
and threw himself upon the bed. The
sufferings of his family and the sufferings
of the whole country were strongly
impressed upon his mind.</p>

<p>The war at this period was carried on
by the British armies in a manner which
was calculated to rouse every feeling of
indignation in the American people.
The southern coasts of the United States
had been ravaged by their troops in a
style befitting pirates rather than soldiers,
and more recently the borders of
Connecticut had met with a similar fate.
New Haven had been attacked, and the
beautiful town of Fairfield had been laid
in ashes. These circumstances were
attended with the most aggravating atrocities.
Private property was destroyed
in mere wantonness. Individuals were
shot down, or butchered by the soldiers,
where no public object could be gained.</p>

<p>In the darkness of his chamber, these
events crowded upon the youth’s imagination.
They came attended with all
the details current at the time, and heightened
by the colors which indignation and
rumor imparted to them. His own fancy,
too, gave them a vividness beyond
the reality; and, amid all these crowding
images, his mother’s words came again
and again upon his heart: “In wanton
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_137">137</span>
sport these British officers fire upon a
human being as a sportsman shoots at a
woodcock or a partridge.”</p>

<p>In this uneasy manner he spent several
hours, but at last fell asleep. After
a brief repose, he awoke, dressed himself,
lighted a candle, and wrote the letter
to his mother which we have already
mentioned. After a few brief preparations,
he went forth. His step was firm,
and his whole bearing showed that his
resolution was taken. The gray dawn
was just visible in the east. As the
youth was about departing, and had already
advanced several rods from the
house, he paused and looked back. The
venerable mansion lay dark and still beneath
the arches of the lofty elms that
spread their branches above it. The
gloom of the scene seemed but an emblem
of the shadows that rested upon
the hearts of those within, and those
once so bright, so cheerful, so happy.
A single tear gathered in the young
man’s eyes; but he dashed it aside, and
strode forward upon his path.</p>

<h3>
<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="Five"><span class="allsmcap">V.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>

<p>Our young adventurer had ascertained
that the Tiger, the British frigate of
which we have already spoken, lay at
anchor in a little harbor of Long Island,
toward the western extremity of the
sound. He had conferred with several
companions of his own age, and with
some friends of his father, who were
still older, and they had signified their
willingness to aid him in any effort for
his father’s release in which he was willing
to lead them.</p>

<p>His present design was to muster these
men, and set forth upon an attempt to
destroy the vessel we have already mentioned,
and, if possible, seize upon the
commander. If this attempt, on farther
examination, should not seem to be feasible,
an effort to seize upon some other
British officer, of which there were several
stationed upon the western part of
Long Island, was to be made.</p>

<p>Proceeding to the house of an active
and energetic friend, young Joinly communicated
his design, and the two, separately
proceeding to the several houses
of their proposed companions, rallied
about thirty of them by the time the sun
had risen. Most of them were young
men, though several of them were of
mature years. One of them was the
owner of a small sloop; and, entering
this, the whole party dropped down the
river.</p>

<p>The celerity with which their preparations
were made is explained by considering
that in these times the knapsack
and the firelock were ready at a
moment’s call. The other necessary
equipments and provisions were easily
supplied. Nearly every man on board
was familiar with the sea, and knew
every rock, current, or shoal along the
shore. They soon spread their sails,
and, hugging the land, proceeded westward
upon their chivalrous expedition.</p>

<p>In the space of three or four days they
had reached the shores of Greenwich.
They then crossed over by night to the
opposite shore of Long Island, in the vicinity
of the Tiger. Running up into
a little shallow bay, sheltered by pine
trees, they came to anchor. As soon as
the morning approached, they despatched
several of the men to reconnoitre. These
returned toward evening of the following
day, and brought the information that
the Tiger was lying, at the distance of
about four miles, at anchor in a small bay.</p>

<p>On the shore was a little village, and
in the vicinity were the houses of several
respectable farmers. One of these houses,
apart from the rest, was occupied by the
principal officers of the ship, who were
indulging on shore in feasting and drinking.
The resolution was soon adopted
by the adventurers to take speedy advantage
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_138">138</span>
of this state of things to put
their scheme in execution. In about a
week their preparations were made, and
they only waited for a dark and tempestuous
night to make the attempt.</p>

<p>In about ten days the desired storm
arrived. It was late in the autumn, and
one of those chilly, north-easterly storms
common to our climate had set in. The
plot of our little band was a singular
one. They had with them an ingenious
mechanic, by the name of Bushnell, who
had been long engaged in preparing machinery,
something like that of a clock,
by which he could ignite powder under
water at any given time. His experiments
had proved at least partially successful,
and rumors of some scheme for
blowing up the British ships at New
York, by this machinery, had got into
circulation. The British were excessively
alarmed, and swept the water
around their vessels, both night and day,
to intercept any infernal engine that
might be stealing upon them.</p>

<p>Bushnell’s plan, on the present occasion,
was to approach the vessel in the
darkness of the night, and, under cover
of the storm, to attach a small skiff, laden
with several barrels of gunpowder, to the
side of the vessel—to connect the machinery
with this, and leave it to explode.
The rest of the men were to be upon the
shore, and, in the confusion which they
expected to follow, to make sure of the
commander of the vessel. The arrangements
were duly made early in the evening,
and about nine o’clock Bushnell
and two companions set off for the ship.</p>

<p>The night was excessively dark, and
the wind, blowing a gale, swept with a
deafening roar through the rigging.
Everything favored the enterprise. Unseen
and unheard, the conspirators stole
over the short chopping waves of the bay,
and, sheltered beneath the projecting
stern of the massy hulk, took their measures
with deliberation.</p>

<p>After a brief space, they departed unnoticed
and unsuspected, leaving the little
skiff, with its burden of death and destruction,
firmly attached beneath the
frigate.</p>

<p>They soon reached the shore, and took
the stations assigned them with their
companions. The machinery was so
adjusted, that it would strike in the space
of half an hour, and communicate the
fatal spark to the powder.</p>

The Musical Snuff-box at Church.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A gentleman</span> had a musical snuff-box
which played two favorite airs, called
“Drops of brandy,” and “The glasses
sparkle on the board.” He went out of
town, one Sunday, to dine with a friend,
taking his box in his pocket.</p>

<p>He went with the family to the church,
and the service was about half through,
when, putting his hand in his pocket,
he accidentally touched the spring of the
box, when it immediately struck up,
“Drops of brandy,” most merrily.</p>

<p>Every eye and every ear was directed
to the spot, to the great dismay and confusion
of the gentleman, who endeavored
to stop the box. His endeavors,
however, only made the difficulty worse,
for the tune immediately changed, and,
“The glasses sparkle on the board,” was
heard distinctly in all parts of the church,
the congregation with difficulty restraining
their mirth.</p>

<p>Finding it impossible to stop the music,
the unfortunate gentleman started
up and hurried out of the church, the
box persisting in playing all the time
that he marched along the aisle. I believe
the unlucky box was never taken
to church again.</p>

John Hancock.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I suppose</span> all my readers have seen
the Declaration of our Independence,
with the signatures attached. John Hancock
was the president of the convention
that drew up that famous instrument,
and was the first who signed it. Every
one must have remarked the bold, strong,
decided hand in which his name is written.
That was a good way to do a great
action—to do it firmly, and in such a
manner as to show that there was no
timidity of heart, no trembling of the
hand, no wavering of purpose.</p>

<p>It is a good thing for all young Americans
to read the lives and study the
characters of the great men of our country;
and it is my purpose frequently to
place the biographies of such individuals
in the pages of Merry’s Museum. I
shall now give a brief sketch of John
Hancock.</p>

<p>He was born at Braintree, in Massachusetts,
in 1737, and inherited a large
fortune from his uncle. He was educated
at Cambridge college, and was elected a
member of the assembly in 1766, and
soon distinguished himself by a talent
for business, and a zealous opposition to
the oppressive acts of the British. In
1774, he was president of the provincial
congress, and the year after was elected
a member of the general congress, which
met at Philadelphia. He was chosen
president of that body, and in that capacity
signed the Declaration of Independence
in 1776.</p>

<p>His health declining the next year, he
left that appointment; but he was elected,
in 1788, the first governor of Massachusetts
under the new constitution. He
held that office for four years. In three
years after, he was again elected governor,
in which station he remained till
his death, which took place in 1793, in
the fifty-sixth year of his age.</p>

<p>Governor Hancock possessed talents
that always adorned the several exalted
stations to which he was elevated. He
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_140">140</span>
was one of the first and most conspicuous
actors in the great drama of the Revolution,
and gained, by his zealous devotion
to his country, a rank among the most
distinguished of her benefactors. In private
life he was characterized by affability,
urbanity, and distinguished liberality
to the poor.</p>

<i>The buffalo hunt.</i><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Five</span> of our hunting party were on
horseback, and the rest on foot. We
proceeded over a hilly country for two
days, meeting with no other game than
a single deer, which was shot by one
of the party, thrown across one of the
horses, and carried onward. We came,
at length, to the borders of an extensive
prairie, which lay spread out like the
sea before us. In taking a general view
of its surface, it seemed to be almost perfectly
level. But as we advanced, I perceived
that it was undulating, like the
ocean thrown into long waves by a gale
of wind.</p>

<p>It was now late in the autumn, but the
prairie was covered with a great variety
of flowers, some of them exceedingly
brilliant and beautiful. I hardly noticed
these objects then. I was with savages,
and they never perceive anything lovely
in flowers, or landscapes, or nature’s
fairest scenes. It might seem that those
who live always in the midst of nature’s
works would feel their beauty and admire
them. But it is not so. The exquisite
emotions excited in a refined mind
by beautiful landscapes and the picturesque
objects of nature, belong only to
those who have enjoyed the advantages
of civilization. No savage is ever either
a painter or a poet. You never see
these dwellers in the wilderness culling
bouquets, or making wreaths of blossoms.</p>

<p>We held a straight course for several
hours, until, at last, we reached a little
dell which was covered with trees. At
a distance, this appeared like an island
in the sea. Here we paused, and preparations
were made to remain for some
days. Early on the ensuing morning,
most of the party were roused and went
forth in quest of game; but the only result
was the killing of two or three deer.
Several days now passed, but on the fifth
day after our arrival we met with more
stirring adventures.</p>

<p>Soon after the sun arose, one of the
Indians announced that a herd of buffaloes
was coming. We all looked in the
direction to which he pointed, and, at the
distance of nearly two miles, we saw an
immense number of objects, seeming like
small black spots on the surface of the
prairie. These gradually approached us,
and we could soon hear a confused noise,
like the distant roar of a tempest. The
Indians were immediately on the alert.</p>

<p>As the wind was blowing toward the
herd, they were afraid that the quick
scent of the buffaloes would perceive us,
and that the affrighted animals would
take to flight. To avoid this danger, we
immediately determined to shift our position.
Those who had horses mounted
them and departed, and those who were
on foot followed them. Some proceeded
to the right and some to the left, making
a wide sweep, and intending to come in
upon the herd in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>We were not long in performing this
manœuvre. I shall never forget the
scene that was now presented. Before
us and near at hand were several thousands
of these huge animals, many of
them equal in size to the largest ox.
They had also an aspect entirely distinct
from our tame cattle. Their swarthy
color, their wild, shaggy hair, their thick
mane, the profusion of rough and bristling
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_141">141</span>
hair about the face, the enormous
hump upon the shoulders, together with
the fierce countenance of these animals,
rendered them objects at once interesting
and formidable.</p>

<p>And if this was their appearance, taken
singly, the spectacle of thousands of
these huge beasts was hardly short of
sublime. The whole mass were moving
slowly forward. Some paused occasionally,
to nip the herbage, or devour the
leaves from a favorite shrub, and others
sauntered on with a careless and indifferent
air. But many of the bulls, and
some of the rest, seemed to be almost
constantly occupied in fighting.</p>

<p>Some were pawing the earth, and scattering
the dust in the air; some were
kneeling and plunging their horns into
the little hillocks of earth, lowing at the
same time, and seeming desirous of giving
a challenge to mortal combat; some
were already fighting, and, with their
horns locked, were straining every nerve
for the mastery; others were leaping
and frisking as they went; and others
still were plunging their horns into the
sides of such of their brethren as came
within their reach. The lowing of the
herd was incessant, and came upon the
ear with a deafening roar. The air was
filled with confused sounds, and the earth
was shaken beneath our feet by the
trampling multitude.</p>

<p>Accustomed as I was to scenes of adventure,
I was still startled at this spectacle,
and, for a time, my mind was
somewhat confused. My excitement was
increased by an incident which immediately
followed. The Indians who had
accompanied me had dispersed themselves,
and being upon the flank of the
herd, and sheltered by the tall grass,
were stealing towards their unsuspecting
victims.</p>

<p>I had myself crouched down in a thick
tuft of grass, upon one of the thousand
swells of the prairie. It chanced that a
buffalo of the largest size, straying a little
from his companions, was coming
directly towards the spot where I lay.
He soon came near, and I could see his
curly pate and the glistening of his eye.
He came slowly, but steadily on. I had
a rifle in my hand, but such was my
amazement that I never thought of using
it. I remained crouched upon one knee
until the animal was within six feet of me.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the consternation
depicted in the brute’s countenance
when he first saw me. He paused
for a moment; his eyeballs stood out,
his nostrils expanded, and the long stiff
hair upon his neck stood erect. After
glaring at me for a few seconds, the
creature lifted his tail into the air, and
sped away with a prodigious gallop.</p>

<p>He had proceeded but a few rods, however,
before I heard the report of a rifle,
and the flying buffalo stumbled and fell
to the earth, tearing up the soil in the
heavy plunge. He, however, rose to his
feet, and proceeded, with a staggering
gallop, for about a hundred yards. He
then paused, and at length stood still.
I came forward, supposing that the wound
was mortal, and that the creature would
soon fall to the earth; but what was my
surprise, on coming up with him, to discover
three or four wolves standing in
front of him, and evidently on the point
of making an attack.</p>

<p>Without reflection, I discharged my
rifle among them, and killed two of them.
The noise directed the attention of the
wounded buffalo to me, and he immediately
turned upon me. I easily kept out
of his way at first; but his speed increased,
and I soon found it necessary to
exert myself to the utmost for escape.
My uncommon speed was now my only
hope. The raging beast followed me at
long bounds, and I was frequently obliged
to throw him off by a short turn to the
right or left, in order to escape from the
plunge of his horns. I had already begun
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_142">142</span>
to grow weary and short of breath, when
I heard a loud bellow and a heavy fall
to the earth. I looked around, and my
pursuer lay dead upon the ground.</p>

<p>After a few moments, my self-possession
returned. I loaded my rifle and
proceeded toward the scene of action,
for my companions were now at their
work. I had an opportunity of seeing
the manner in which the Indians on
horseback attack the buffalo. I chanced
to be near one of our bravest huntsmen
as he assailed a bull of the largest size.
The man was firmly mounted, but he
had no other weapons than a bow and a
quiver of arrows. The buffalo had perceived
the approach of the enemy, and
immediately fled at full gallop.</p>

<p>The hunter pursued, and, speedily
coming up with the animal, he drew his
arrow to the head, and plunged it between
its ribs. It entered more than one half
its length, but the buffalo continued its
flight. Another and another arrow were
speedily discharged, and all of them took
effect. The last was almost entirely
buried in the flank of the huge beast.
Stung with agony, he wheeled suddenly
round, and made a fierce plunge at the
mounted horseman. The movement was
sudden and rapid, but the blow was
evaded by a swaying movement to the
left. The impulse of the horseman carried
him past the animal for a considerable
distance, and the latter, apparently
incapable of farther exertion, stood still.</p>

<p>His sides were covered with blood, and
mingled foam and blood were streaming
from his open mouth. He held his head
down, his tongue protruded, his eyes stood
out, and he shivered in every limb. At
the same time, he uttered a low and
plaintive bellow. The unrelenting hunter
speedily turned his horse back, and again
approached his prey. He paused a moment,
and seemed to hesitate whether it
were needful to spend another arrow;
but, after a short space, he placed one
upon the string. The bison watched the
movement, and, at the instant it sped, uttered
a terrible roar, and sprung again
toward the horseman. The latter, prepared
for the movement, leaped aside,
and the exhausted prey rolled, with a
crushing sound, to the earth. The last
arrow had reached his heart.</p>

<p>I looked over the vast plain, and the
countless herd of bisons were now in full
flight; plunging, galloping, and bellowing,
they swept over the plain. It is
impossible to give an adequate idea of
the scene. A variety of stunning sounds
fell upon the ear, and the earth trembled
as if shaken by an earthquake. Yet,
amid this scene of confusion, the Indians
seemed in their element. Mingling with
the crowd of animals, their arrows flew,
and their bullets sped. Those who were
on foot, and those who were mounted,
alike kept up with the flying herd.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the fierceness
of their looks, or the animation of their
actions. Their whole souls engaged in
the work of death; their hair streaming
in the wind, their eyes gleaming with
fiery exultation, and speeding from point
to point with incredible swiftness; they
had an aspect of wildness, energy, and
power, which words alone cannot paint.
For my own share in the adventure I
can say but little. I had several fair
shots, but they were all without success,
excepting in one instance. A buffalo
calf, toward the latter part of the
chase, was passing near, and I brought
it down with a single ball.</p>

<p>I must not omit to mention one incident,
that particularly attracted my attention
in the midst of these scenes.
From the moment the attack began, I
had noticed several wolves gliding hither
and thither, and seeming to watch the
progress of the fight. These creatures
follow the herds of bisons, and, if one of
them becomes sick or wounded, they attack
and devour him. They seemed now
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_143">143</span>
to be quite aware that something was to
be done in their behalf, and, accordingly,
gathered in considerable numbers to the
place where the attack was about to be
made.</p>

<p>Several buffaloes had now been slain,
and others were wounded. As I was
passing along, I saw a buffalo that had
received a bullet in his side, and was severely
hurt. The creature seemed exhausted
and incapable of flight. As if
understanding the exact nature of the
case, several wolves had gathered around
him, and, squatting upon their haunches
at a respectful distance, were waiting the
moment when the animal should be sufficiently
feeble to render it safe for them
to make the attack. At my approach,
however, the buffalo made a new effort,
and galloped beyond my reach, followed,
however, by his unrelenting and greedy
attendants.</p>

<p>In about half an hour after the attack
commenced, it was all over. The herd
had passed on; but scattered along, for
the space of three or four miles, lay no
less than sixteen dead buffaloes, the fruit
of our efforts. I must say, however,
that the packs of wolves, which constantly
hung around the buffaloes, devoured two
or three that we had killed before we
could secure them.</p>

<p>Several days were spent in skinning
our game; in cutting off the best parts
of the meat, and in preparations for our
return. At last, having loaded our horses
with the hides and a portion of the meat,
and each man taking what he could carry,
we set out upon our journey, and,
after a laborious march, reached the settlement.</p>

<h2>
The new London Exchange.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bank of England is the focus of
the money operations of London. It is
situated in that part of the metropolis
called the city, about a mile and a half
to the east of Temple Bar.</p>

<p>This bank is an immense quadrangular
building, with a large court in the
centre. The number of rooms in the
edifice are numerous, and a person without
a guide would inevitably get lost
amid its labyrinth of staircases, passages,
rooms, entries, and offices. During the
business hours of the day, there are constant
streams of people passing in and
out of this great temple of mammon.</p>

<p>The number of officers and clerks employed
in the bank is very great, and, in
some of the rooms, you see them shovelling
heaps of gold, almost as freely and
as abundantly as if it were Indian corn.
Near the bank is the post-office, which
is also an immense edifice. The number
of persons at work within the bustle
and activity that are exhibited there, the
marking of parcels, the tumbling about
of mail-bags, the running hither and
thither, seem almost to render the place
a city in itself.</p>

<p>Near these two great buildings are the
offices of the chief bankers of London,
who receive and pay out immense sums
of money at their counters every day.
All the streets in this region are mainly
occupied by persons who are engaged in
the great money operations of the metropolis.
Nothing can exceed the bustle
and activity of this part of the city.
The streets are thronged with cabs,
coaches, omnibuses, and other vehicles,
and with a ceaseless flood of people,
passing rapidly on, as if they thought
the world was speedily coming to an end.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_145">145</span>Near to the bank was formerly the
old Exchange, which was a four-sided
building, in the court of which, merchants,
bankers, and others in London,
were accustomed to assemble for the purpose
of transacting business. This court
was quadrangular, and, on the four sides,
were the emblems of the four quarters
of the globe. On that side where the
emblems of Europe were, European
business was transacted; on the Asiatic
side, business relating to Asia was transacted;
and so of the rest.</p>

<p>The time of assembly, in this Exchange,
was usually from two to four
o’clock. At these hours, you would here
see a crowd of persons; and the amount
of business transacted within this little
square, in the space of a couple of hours,
often amounted to several millions of
pounds sterling.</p>

<p>For several years past, the opinion
had prevailed, in London, that the old
Exchange was small, inconvenient, and
unworthy of the great commercial metropolis
of the world. A scheme was,
therefore, set on foot for erecting a new
Exchange, which might at once be convenient,
and suited, by its extent and
magnificence, to satisfy the wants as well
as the ambition of the great emporium of
Britain.</p>

<p>The building has already been commenced,
and considerable progress has
been made in its construction. London
has hundreds of edifices, any one of
which would be an object of interest and
curiosity, on account of its extent and
magnificence, on our side of the Atlantic.
But the new Exchange promises to
rank among the very finest of the public
buildings of London, both on account of its
size and the beauty of its architecture.</p>

<p>The corner-stone of this fine structure
was laid on the 17th of January, 1842,
and appears to have been one of the
most imposing ceremonies, of the kind,
that ever took place. An immense crowd
of people was assembled, among whom
were many persons of the highest distinction.
The performances took place
beneath a tent, in which there were about
fifteen thousand persons.</p>

<p>This tent was one hundred feet high,
and three hundred feet in circumference.
Around it were eleven tiers of seats,
gradually rising to the height of twenty-four
feet. These seats, as well as the
floor and sides of the tent, were covered
with crimson drapery. It was lighted
by a magnificent chandelier, containing
about fifty gas lights. In the centre of
the tent was an open space, in which the
foundation-stone, an immense block of
free-stone, was suspended. In front of it
were two chairs of state, one for Prince
Albert and the other for the lord mayor.</p>

<p>All things being ready, Prince Albert
deposited, in an excavation in the stone,
a glass bottle, containing a variety of
coins, both gold, silver, and copper. A
glass brick was also deposited, with an
English inscription encrusted thereon.
These were covered with a stone, and,
the prince applied the level to see that
it was true. Some mortar was put into
the crevices, and his royal highness
smoothed it down, in a very workmanlike
manner, with a silver trowel, exquisitely
fabricated for the purpose. An enthusiastic
cheer rung through the assembly,
to attest the appreciation of the skill displayed
by the prince. The stone was
lowered to its bed, and the mighty pageant
was over.</p>

The Imperial Joss.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the chief idol of the Chinese
empire, and is worshipped with profound
reverence by many persons, especially
by the chief dignitaries. The present
emperor, whose name is Taou Twang,
and who is now about seventy years old,
is very particular in his devotions to the
Imperial Joss. This image is variously
represented, but always exhibits the appearance
of a very fat man, with an enormous
belly,—one who is fond of good
eating and good drinking, and who cares
for little else.</p>

<p>A man’s religion is usually an index
to his own character. If we may judge
the higher classes of Chinese by their
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_147">147</span>
deity, we should suppose that, if they
are not better than their gods, they are a
low, coarse, and sensual people.</p>

<p>The Chinese temples, or Joss houses,
are very magnificent; and it is said that
there are, in the empire, about five hundred
of these of the larger kind. When
the emperor goes to worship the imperial
deity, he dresses himself with the utmost
magnificence, and is attended by all his
officers of state, sumptuously apparelled.
But while he thus displays the greatest
external grandeur, he exhibits great humility
and dejection, prostrating himself
upon the earth, rolling himself in the
dust, and speaking of himself, to the
object of his adoration, in terms of the
utmost abasement.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Canton, there is a
Joss house, which makes a magnificent
appearance. It is four stories high, with
a fine cupola. It has, also, numerous
galleries and out-houses.</p>

<h2>
A Salt Water Scene.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one of the recent fishing excursions
in our bay, the steward of the steamer
had employed, as assistant cook, a simple
negro, who had “never before smelt
salt water,” nor knew its peculiar properties.
There were a hundred persons
on board to feed, and, not having a very
large supply of water on board, at the
first dinner the steward took his aid severely
to task for wasting the fresh water
in boiling the vegetables, when the salt
water, alongside, was so much better for
the purpose. Poor Darky promised to
do better next time; and, accordingly, on
the following morning, when the bell
rang for breakfast, the aforesaid hundred
half-famished people rushed up to
the table, and, seizing the coffee-cups,
each quaffed a copious draught, when,
phew! phiz! splutter! what a spitting
and coughing there ensued! “Steward!

cook! captain! where are you? what is
the matter of the coffee?” shouted a
Babel of vehement voices. The steward
appeared, and protested his ignorance
of anything wrong, when a deputation
was sent for poor cook, and he soon
appeared amid the excited multitude,
trembling, and as pale as he could be.
“What is the matter with this coffee?”
demanded the captain.</p>

<p>“I sure I don’t know, massa,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Where did you get the water that
you made it of?”</p>

me for wasting the fresh water for bile
the ’taters, and said de salt was better;

in good humor, to wait the making of

<p><span class="smcap">The Shoulder of Mutton.</span>—The
blade bone of a shoulder of mutton is
called in Scotland “a poor man,” as in
some parts of England it is termed “a
poor knight of Windsor.” Some years
ago, an old Scottish peer chanced to be
indisposed whilst he was in London attending
parliament. The master of the
hotel where he lodged, anxious to show
attention to his noble guest, waited on
him to enumerate the contents of his
well-stocked larder, so as to endeavor to
hit on something which might suit his
appetite. “I think, landlord,” said his
lordship, rising up from his couch, and
throwing back the tartan plaid with which
he had screened his grim and ferocious
visage, “I think I could eat a morsel of
<em>a poor man</em>.” The landlord fled in terror,
having no doubt that his guest was
a cannibal, who might be in the habit of
eating a slice of a tenant, as light food,
when under a regimen.</p>

The Life of Columbus.<br>

<p class="hanging"><i>Columbus sails for Spain—Manner in which Columbus
was welcomed on his arrival in Spain.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus determined to return to
Spain, Columbus selected thirty-nine of
the crew, who were to remain. He established
rules for their government, and,
having made all the provision for their
comfort in his power, he gave them a
parting address. He recommended to
them to treat the natives and one another
kindly; to live amicably; to settle disputes
which might arise; and he promised
them, should his life be spared, to
return to them at a future day.</p>

<p>On the 4th of January, 1493, all things
being settled, a signal gun announced
their readiness to depart. A mutual
farewell was pronounced, and the sails
of the Nina were soon spread to the wind.
Two days after their departure, while a
head wind was blowing strongly against
them, and they made but little progress,
the long-lost Pinta was seen bearing down
upon them.</p>

<p>This was a joyful sight. Nothing
certain had been heard of her since her
separation from the other vessels. Fears
were entertained that she was lost. But
Columbus had all along suspected that
her captain had separated from him with
a design to search for islands where he
might find gold. And so it proved to be.</p>

<p>The captain, however, pretended otherwise.
He endeavored to convince Columbus
that he had no bad design, and
had been detained by unpropitious weather
and ignorance of the route to Cuba.
But all this was untrue. He had visited
several islands, and procured gold, half
of which he kept himself, and the rest
he divided among his crew, telling them
to keep it a secret. Columbus would
have arrested him; but as he had now
only one small vessel beside the Pinta,

he wisely concluded to say but little, and
hasten back to Spain.</p>

<p>The wind becoming favorable soon
after, both vessels directed their course
eastward, stopping, however, at several
islands in their way. At one island,
where they anchored, an unhappy circumstance
occurred. Some of the Spaniards
landed here. They found the island
inhabited by a ferocious-looking people.
They had long bows, swords, and war-clubs.
These last were made of a kind
of wood so hard and so heavy as to level
the stoutest man at a single blow.</p>

<p>At first, these savages conducted peaceably
towards the Spaniards; nevertheless,
their looks bespoke treachery and
war. One of them returned with the
Spaniards on board the Nina. He was
treated very kindly, and several presents
were given him. This was done to secure
the friendship of his brethren on
the island.</p>

<p>At length, this Indian was put on shore.
As the boat approached the land, a party
of warriors were seen lurking in the
edge of some woods not far distant. As
the boat reached the shore, they laid aside
their arms, and approached in apparent
friendship. They began to trade with
the Spaniards, and sold them two bows.</p>

<p>But, on a sudden, they fell back, seized
their weapons, and rushed forward to
secure the Spaniards. The latter, finding
themselves in danger, attacked the
Indians, and wounded several. They
would have made greater execution, but
they were ordered by the commander
of the party to return.</p>

<p>Columbus regretted this occurrence.
It was the first unpleasant interview
which he and his men had had with the
inhabitants of the new world. But, happily,
before Columbus left the neighborhood,
the affray was peaceably settled.
The chief of the Indians was a noble-spirited
man, and seemed much to regret
the conduct of his subjects. He made
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_149">149</span>
a present to Columbus, and even visited
him on board his vessel.</p>

<p>Columbus now prepared to take leave
of these islands, and set sail once more
upon the broad ocean. Every day’s delay
was felt to be hazardous. A slight
accident might prevent their ever reaching
Spain; and thus their important discovery,
their toils, and their dangers,
would all be lost. Their voyage, also,
with all the skill and diligence they
might exercise, was likely to be a long
one. The trade winds were against
them, and the Pinta had become so weak,
that no great press of sail could be put
upon her.</p>

<p>Nothing important occurred till the
13th of February. The day previous,
a gale had begun to blow, and the sea
was greatly disturbed. On the evening
of the 13th, the indications of an approaching
tempest were still stronger; and, not
long after, it burst upon them in awful
fury.</p>

<p>All that night their sails were lashed
down tight; and yet, such was the violence
of the gale, that they were driven
forward with the speed of a race-horse.
In the morning, they were still on the
top of the waves, though every moment
likely to be swallowed up. Through all
that day the vessels kept in sight of each
other; but each, as it rose on the mountain
wave, expected to take its last look
of its companion.</p>

<p>The night again set in. The spirit
of the tempest was still unbroken; nay,
it seemed as if the very elements were
all engaged in war. The ocean, lashed
by the storm, raged and roared, and
every succeeding billow was still more
mountainous than the one which had
gone before. Each vessel continued to
display a light, at intervals, as a signal
to the other. For a time, that displayed
by the Pinta was seen on board the Nina;
but it grew more and more dim and distant,
and, at length, was looked for in vain.
</p>

<p>It was a tremendous night, and it
seemed that only by a miracle the vessel
could survive the fury of the gale. But,
on the dawn of the following morning,
she was still riding aloft, though she
seemed, every moment, on the brink of
ruin.</p>

<p>The courageous spirit of Columbus
was the last to quail. He did not yet
despair; but he, himself, was appalled.
It was probable that the Pinta had gone
down. It was more than probable that
his own vessel would that day sink to
some unexplored cavern in the abyss.
His life and that of his crew were valuable.
But it was of still greater moment
to the world that the knowledge
of his discovery should not be lost.</p>

<p>In this distressed and troubled state—in
this season of awful suspense, Columbus
was not unmindful of prayers and
vows. But, alas! he prayed not to the
God of the ocean; his vows were not
made to him. In those days, it was the
custom of many, in times of peril, to
pray to the Virgin Mary, and to make a
vow, if preserved, to go on a pilgrimage.
This Columbus and his men now did;
as if the Virgin Mary could save them;
as if to go bareheaded, on their hands
and feet, for miles and leagues, would be
pleasing to God!</p>

<p>How much more proper it would have
been to have sought the protection of
<em>Him</em> who rideth upon the wings of the
wind, and maketh the clouds his chariots;
who alone could say to the noisy
waters, “Peace, be still.” The prayers
and vows of Columbus seemed of little
avail. Why should they have been
heard, when the true God of the waters
was lost sight of, and creatures were
worshipped instead of himself?</p>

<p>The storm still went on in its fury:
billow was followed by billow, surge was
piled upon surge. Columbus began to
consider in what manner he could communicate
to the eastern world a knowledge
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_150">150</span>
of his discovery. There was one
expedient which might succeed, if he
should be lost, and he now proceeded to
adopt it.</p>

<p>He wrote a brief account of his voyage
and discoveries on a piece of parchment,
which he hastily enclosed in a cake
of wax, and, putting this latter into a
barrel, he threw it into the sea, with the
hope that it might, at length, be picked
up by some one who would inform the
king and queen of Spain of the important
news it contained.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, the storm soon
after somewhat abated, and, to their inexpressible
joy, land appeared in view,
which proved to be the island of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s,
the most southern of the Azores.</p>

<p>For two days, after they discovered
land, the Nina was tossed about, it being
impossible to reach a harbor. At length
they cast anchor; but, before morning,
they parted their cable, and were again
exposed to the most imminent danger
of being shipwrecked.</p>

<p>We must pass over many interesting
events and trying scenes which occurred
before Columbus had the good fortune to
arrive at Palos. We must briefly mention
here that, at length, when Columbus
reached <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s, the government of
that island seized a part of the crew of
the Nina, who had landed, and attempted
to take Columbus himself. The island
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s belonged to the king of
Portugal, who had given his subjects orders
to seize Columbus, should it be in
their power. The reason for this was a
jealousy, on the part of that king, that
Columbus might interfere with voyages
of discovery which were undertaken under
his own direction.</p>

<p>The difficulties at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s were,
however, settled, and Columbus at length
proceeded towards Spain. Another storm
now came on, and drove him into a port
of Portugal. He would have avoided
touching at any port of Portugal, could
he have done so with safety. But, having
been struck by a squall of wind, he
was obliged to make the first harbor he
was able.</p>

<p>From this place he wrote to the king
of Portugal, informing him of his situation,
and requested permission to go
with his vessel to Lisbon. This request
was granted. On his arrival at this place,
the inhabitants crowded on board to listen
to the stories of the crew, and to see
various articles of curiosity, which they
had brought from the new world.</p>

<p>The king of Portugal was at this time
at Valparaiso, about twenty-seven miles
from Lisbon. From the former place,
he despatched a messenger to Columbus,
inviting him to the royal residence. Columbus
wished not to go, justly fearing
that some evil was designed him. But,
at length, he deemed it wise to accept
the invitation.</p>

<p>On reaching Valparaiso, he related
his adventures to the king, and his discoveries,
and the perils of his return.
The king listened with deep attention,
and, though he treated Columbus kindly,
it was evident that he felt deeply mortified
that he had lost the honor of this
important discovery, when he might have
employed Columbus himself.</p>

<p>Some of the king’s counsellors endeavored
to prejudice him against Columbus,
and, it is said, advised the king
to have him murdered. But Columbus
was at length dismissed in safety, and
again set sail for Palos. A few days
brought him in sight of this long wished-for
port, and, on the 15th of March, at
noon, the anchor of the Nina was cast in
the spot from which it had been raised
about seven months and a half before.</p>

<p>The joy of Columbus and his crew,
on reaching Palos, may, perhaps, be imagined,
but cannot be described. The joy
of the inhabitants was not less intense.
The vessel was descried coming up the
river, and was recognised as one of those
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_151">151</span>
which had been abroad on a voyage of
discovery.</p>

<p>The news rapidly spread along the
streets; business was suspended, and the
people were seen rushing to the wharves;
all was hurry, curiosity, and bustle. Yes,
there was much anxiety on the part of
many. They had friends there; or, it
might be, they were lost. But one vessel
had arrived. Where were the others?
One person had a husband: was
he alive? a father, a brother: were they
on board this vessel? or——. The anxiety
was deep, and no wonder.</p>

<p>The ship was anchored, the sails were
furled, and Columbus and his almost bewildered
men now landed, amidst the
greetings of the assembled multitude.
Inquiries, one after another, went round
in quick succession. Explanations were
made as well as the hurry and confusion
would allow. A long procession
was formed, and Columbus and his men
were marched to a church, where public
thanks were returned for their success
and safe return.</p>

<p>To heighten the joy of the people of
Palos, it was so ordered that, on the evening
of this very day, the Pinta was also
seen standing up the river. She had
been separated from Columbus, we have
told, and was supposed to be lost. But it
was not so. She had, however, only escaped
as if by a miracle. She had been
tossed up and down, and driven before the
tempest, for days, and had, at length, succeeded
in getting into a port, from whence,
after the gale had subsided, she proceeded
on her return; and now she came
in, to add to the joy of the justly delighted
people of Palos.</p>

<p>One circumstance is related, which all
who read this story would wish to have
otherwise. I have spoken of the improper
conduct of Pinzon, the commander
of the Pinta, while in Hispaniola, in leaving
Columbus. From the violence of
the gale, which separated him from the
Nina, he had some reason to conclude
that she was lost, just as Columbus supposed
the Pinta was lost. But, instead
of waiting to ascertain whether this was
a fact, Pinzon, on putting into port, sent
a letter to the king and queen of Spain,
informing them of the discovery which
<em>he</em> had made, and claiming all the honor
of it.</p>

<p>This was ungenerous, as well as wicked.
But what was his surprise to find
that Columbus had arrived before him!
What was his mortification to learn the
honors which the real discoverer of the
new world was receiving, at the very
time he came in with the expectation of
taking all the honor to himself!</p>

<p>Pinzon was afraid and ashamed to
meet Columbus. He, therefore, avoided
being seen, and, not long after, died at
his own house, the victim of his own
pride and folly. Still higher honors
awaited Columbus than those which he
had received from the inhabitants of Palos.
The letter, which he had written
to the king and queen of Spain, had prepared
the way for his gracious reception.
Indeed, the news of his discovery spread
everywhere, and filled the whole country
with admiration and delight.</p>

<p>In a short time, Columbus proceeded
to Barcelona, to inform the king and
queen more particularly concerning his
voyage, and about the new world which
he had discovered. On his journey,
multitudes flocked, from the surrounding
country, to see this wonderful man and
the natives of the new world, several of
whom had accompanied him to Spain.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Barcelona, his reception
at court was truly flattering. The
king and queen did not attempt to conceal
their pleasure at the success of his voyage,
and took every means to load him with
honor. He was received in great state,
and, in the presence of the whole court,
the king and queen even rose to welcome
him: nay, he had the privilege of
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_152">152</span>
seating himself in their presence,—an
honor seldom granted to any one.</p>

<p>Columbus now gave an account of his
voyage; told them of the new world;
exhibited the curiosities which he had
brought back; and, more than all—the
indisputable evidence of the truth of what
he had told them—the natives, whom he
now presented to the king and queen.</p>

<p>It may be proper to dwell a moment
upon the change in the circumstances of
Columbus. For many years he had
been endeavoring to effect a darling project.
He had struggled with misfortune;
he had fought his way without money,
without patrons—nay, in opposition to
powerful enemies. Less than a year before,
he was a humble individual, and
accounted by many a visionary and a
fortune-hunter. But now he stood in the
presence of the sovereigns of Spain, welcomed
and honored by them, and an
acknowledged benefactor to the world.</p>

<p>The news of his discovery soon spread
through Europe, and it was justly considered
by far the greatest achievement
of the age. Its results have been even
greater than were anticipated; for, in the
space of three centuries and a half, we
see the new world occupied by several
great and independent nations, with systems
of government which are likely to
revolutionize Europe itself.</p>

<p>We shall mention, in this place, one
circumstance, which we cannot think of
but with regret. Our readers will remember
that the person who first discovered
land was to have a reward of
thirty crowns a year for life. Columbus,
we have said in a preceding page, first
saw a light, which had been kindled by
the natives, but a seaman first actually
discovered the land. It was a question
to whom the reward belonged—to Columbus
or to the seaman. It was given
to Columbus. One would think that it
should have been given to the seaman,
and that Columbus himself would have
wished it. The honor, no doubt, was
thought more of, by Columbus, than the
money.</p>

Inquisitive Jack.<br>
</h2>
<h3>
<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="Ten"><span class="allsmcap">X.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>
</div>

<p class="center"><i>Something worth knowing.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> already told my readers that
our little hero, whom we call Inquisitive
Jack, was of a very investigating turn
of mind. I do not mean to say that he
was curious and inquisitive about improper
things. He had not that unpleasant
trait of character, which belongs to
some people and some children—a constant
disposition to be curious and inquisitive
about other people’s affairs. If he
was a kind of Paul Pry, his curiosity
only led him to pry into the works of
nature and art, and not to be meddlesome
in the affairs of other people.</p>

<p>I believe I have also said that, when
Jack became interested in a subject, he
did not like to leave it till he knew all
about it. He did not, like some little
people, proceed from one object to another,
amusing himself for a moment, and
laying up no permanent stores of knowledge.
He was more like the little insect
of which we have told so long a story—the
bee—which, when it alights upon a
blossom, scrapes out all the honey, and
then stores it away in cells for future
use. So it was with Jack. He studied
one subject at a time, made himself master
of the knowledge it afforded, packed
it away in the cells of his memory, and
then was ready to set about something
else.</p>

<p>Well, on account of this trait of character,
he would not leave the subject of
bees until he had extracted from Aunt
Betsey all she knew of the subject—all
the learning she had got. I have already
told you many things which he
learned, but there are many others which
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_153">153</span>
I have not related. I must now tell you
a few of these, and then we will proceed
to something else.</p>

<p>Jack had an idea, which is common
to children, that all domestic animals
were naturally tame; and he was greatly
surprised to learn that dogs, cats, cows,
hens, pigs, horses, and even bees, were
originally wild, and had been brought
into their present state by the arts of
man. In the course of his conversations
with Aunt Betsey, he acquired these
new ideas, and he was then very curious
to hear about wild bees and bee-hunters.
Accordingly, his kind-hearted relative
proceeded to satisfy his inquiries upon
this subject. The substance of what she
told him was as follows:</p>

<p>In nearly all countries there are swarms
of wild bees, which have their abode in
the forest. Their hive is the hollow
trunk of some aged tree. Here they
build their cells and store their honey.
The native flowers of the forest, of the
valley, and the mountain, of the hill-side
and the lawn, afford them a supply of
their delicious food, not only for the daily
meal, during the warm season, but for
the stores of winter.</p>

<p>It is a part of the plan of the benevolent
Creator, that every portion of the
universe shall be filled with life, so that
happiness may everywhere abound.
Even where man has not yet made his
way in the wilderness and the solitary
place, there are the flowers, with their
honey, and there, amid other insects, is
the busy, happy bee, to gather it. How
vast must be the field of enjoyment
which the omniscient eye surveys, if
even the study of insects unfolds such a
view as is here suggested.</p>

<p>The habits of the wild bees are nearly
the same as those of the domestic ones.
They live in large communities, build
their cells in hexagons, are subject to the
government of a queen, and have their
periodical swarms, as we have related.
</p>

<p>The hunting of wild bees is very common
in the western states of this country.
In some parts they are so abundant,
that some persons become regular bee-hunters.
Their mode of finding the
hives is curious and interesting.</p>

<p>I must tell you that, when a bee sets
off from a flower, to return to the hive,
it always flies home in a straight line.
It is one of the amazing instincts of this
little creature, that, wherever it may be,
it has the power of going to its home
without deviation from a direct course.
It may wander in the woods, it may sport
amid the mazes of the flowery meadow,
yet still the little creature never gets its
head turned, never gets lost. The moment
that its honey-bags are filled, it
mounts upward on the breeze, and, without
hesitation, speeds like an arrow to
its mark.</p>

<p>The bee-hunter takes advantage of
this curious trait in the bee. He sees
in what direction the insect flies, and, by
following on, is able, at last, to discover
the hive. A practised bee-hunter often
adopts this method. He notices the direction
in which a bee flies from one
flower, and sets down two or three sticks
to mark the route. He then goes to a
little distance, and starts another bee,
and marks the route he takes. If the
two lines tend toward each other, he
concludes that the angle at which they
meet is the point where the hive is to be
found. Judging of the distance by the
skill acquired by practice, the hunter
proceeds to the spot, and seldom fails of
finding the honey which he seeks pretty
near the place which his calculations
have indicated.</p>

<p>The scientific bee-hunter sometimes
adopts the following method: he places
some bee-bread, in order to tempt the
bees, on a flat board or tile, and draws a
circle round it with white paint. The
bee always settles upon the edge of anything
flat; so she must travel through
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_154">154</span>
the paint to reach the edge. When she
flies away, the white paint on her body
enables the hunter to observe her flight,
and her course is marked down with a
pocket compass. The same thing is
done at another spot, some distance from
the first, and, by comparing the direction
of the two lines, the situation of the nest
is easily found, as it must be at the point
where the lines would meet.</p>

<p>We are told that, in Africa, there is a
curious little hunter of the wild bee.
This is a quadruped, about as large as
a woodchuck, called the honey-ratel.
This cunning little fellow seems to understand
optics; for, when he wishes to
get a distinct view of the bees, he holds
up one of his fore paws, as you would
your hand, in order to shade his eyes,
and thus exclude from the pupil of the
eye an excess of light. He watches the
bees, particularly at sunset, for he knows
that, like other working people, they are
then retiring to their homes. Following
the route they take, he is able to find
out the vicinity of the hive, and, when
he has come pretty near, his keen scent
directs him to the honey which he
seeks.</p>

<p>There is, also, in the wilds of Africa,
a little bird called the honey-guide. This
creature has the faculty of finding out
where the honey is stored, and it is said
that, when he meets a traveller in the
wilderness, he will flutter along before
him, from branch to branch, and from
tree to tree, and, at last, guide him to
the hive.</p>

<p>I remember to have read a story, of
this kind, a great many years ago, when
I was a boy. It was in the beautiful
tale of Alphonso and Dalinda, told by
Madame de Genlis, in her Tales of the
Castle. I have never forgotten it; and no
story, that I have since heard, has seemed
half so pleasing. Does it not seem, indeed,
almost like an incident of fairy
land, that travellers, wandering in the
wilds of Africa, should find a little bird,

who becomes their guide to a feast of
honey?</p>

<p>If I were to repeat all that Aunt Betsey
Piper told her nephew about bees, I
am afraid that I should fill a book. So
I may as well bring this chapter to an
end, after saying a few words about other
kinds of bees.</p>

<p>I might talk a long time about the
humble-bee, or, as some of my little
readers call him, the bumble-bee. He
is very large, and goes about with an
air of importance, like some fat, bustling
people that we know of. He has
one habit which it is well not to imitate,
and that is, of always humming
a tune as he roams about. This bee
makes his nest of moss, in the hayfield,
usually beneath a heap of stones,
or in some excavation of the earth.
Two or three dozen usually assemble
together, and carry on the various operations
of the little community.</p>

<p>The mason bee builds her nest in the
hole of an old wall, of little pieces of
clay. She makes four or five cells, of
the size of a thimble, in each of which
she lays an egg. The carpenter bee
makes a nest in an old post, by boring a
hole, twelve inches long, with her teeth.
In these holes she lays her eggs.</p>

<p>We could tell some of Aunt Betsey’s
curious stories about upholstery bees and
leaf-cutter bees, and we could say a good
deal about their spiteful cousins, the
wasps and hornets. But we must close
the chapter by remarking, that all these
different branches of the bee family live
in communities, make and store honey,
hatch their young from eggs, adopt a
kind of despotic government, and carry
a sharp sword sheathed in the tail.</p>

<h2>
Stomach of the Horse.<br>
</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we think of the adaptations of
animal structure to the different conditions
of living creatures, the camel, the
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_155">155</span>
ship of the desert, immediately occurs;
and no doubt it is highly interesting to
observe how this animal is adapted to
the sandy wastes, in its eye, its nostril,
its foot, the cells of its stomach, and its
capacity of endurance. But it is, perhaps,
more important to look to <em>our</em>
domestic animals, and, of all, the most
deserving of attention is the horse.</p>

<p>Of all creatures, the horse has the
smallest stomach, relatively to its size.
Had he the quadruple, ruminating stomach
of the ox, he would not have been
at all times ready for exertion; the traveller
could not have baited his steed and
immediately resumed his journey. The
stomach of the horse is not so capacious,
even when distended, as to impede his
wind and speed; and the food is passing
onward with a greater degree of regularity
than in any other animal.</p>

<p>A proof of this is, that the horse has
no gall bladder. Most people understand
that bile is necessary to digestion,
and the gall-bladder is a receptacle for
that bile. Where the digestive process
is performed in a large stomach, and the
food descends in larger quantities, and
at long intervals, the gall bladder is
necessary; and there is that sympathy
between the stomach and gall bladder that
they are filled and emptied at the same
time. The absence of the gall bladder
in the horse, therefore, implies the almost
continual process of digestion, which
again results from the smallness of the
stomach.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity in the horse is the
supply of fluid. When the camel drinks,
the water is deposited in cells connected
with the stomach; but if a horse drinks
a pail of water, in eight minutes none of
that water is in the stomach; it is rapidly
passing off into the large intestines
and cœcum. We cannot resist the
conviction that this variation in the
digestive organs of the horse is in correspondence
with his whole form and
properties, which are for sudden and powerful,
as well as long-continued exertion.</p>

<h2>
Patriotism.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> interesting story of Codrus, the
last king of Athens, is handed down by
the historian. When the Heraclidæ
made war against Athens, one of the
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_156">156</span>
oracles, in which the Grecians placed
great confidence, and which they were
accustomed to consult on important
occasions, declared that victory would
be granted to them provided they abstained
from injuring the Athenian
king.</p>

<p>Codrus was a man of noble soul, and
preferred the happiness of his country
to everything else. Accordingly, he determined
to sacrifice his life in order to
secure success to the Athenians. With
this view, he dressed himself as a common
person and entered the enemy’s
camp. He provoked a quarrel with a
soldier, and was immediately slain.</p>

<p>The Heraclidæ soon discovered that
they had killed the Athenian king, and,
knowing that they had violated the condition
upon which the oracle promised
them success, became alarmed, and discontinued
the war.

<h2 class="no-break">
The Wooden Horse.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most famous poems ever
produced, is that entitled the Iliad. This
was written by a man called Homer, who
composed it in several different fragments,
and went about the country reciting
them to the people. He lived
about nine hundred years before Christ.</p>

<p>The scene of the Iliad is laid along
the north-eastern shore of the Mediterranean
sea. It gives an account of a
terrible war, carried on by the Greeks
against the city of Troy. This lasted
for ten years, and resulted in the overthrow
of that city. The events, as related
by Homer, are, many of them,
curious and remarkable. He not only
describes the deeds of military heroes,
but he represents the gods and goddesses,—such
as Jupiter, Mars, Mercury, Juno,
Venus, and others, as taking part in the
struggle; at one time aiding and animating
their friends, and, at another,
baffling or overthrowing their enemies.</p>

<p>The principal leaders, on the part of
the Greeks, are Ajax, Achilles and Ulysses.
Those on the part of the Trojans,
were Hector, Priam and Paris. The
characters of these heroes are drawn
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_157">157</span>
with great power and skill by the poet,
though we cannot but shudder at the
bloody and savage acts which they perform.
The manner in which Troy was
at last taken, is thus related by Homer.
It seems that Ulysses, who was a very
artful and contriving man, caused an immense
wooden horse to be made, capable
of holding a considerable number of people.
This was filled with soldiers, and
offered, as a present, to the Trojans.
These, having no suspicion of what was
in the horse, accepted the present with
great pleasure. A part of the walls,
which surrounded and defended the city,
was removed, and the immense horse
was rolled in, amid the acclamations of
the crowd. The breach in the wall was
then closed up, and the Trojans were
left with their admired, but dangerous
present.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night, when the
people of Troy were wrapped in profound
sleep, the soldiers, who were locked up
in the bowels of the horse, stole out and
spread themselves over the city. They
then set fire to it in various places, and
opened the gates to their friends, the
Greeks, without. These were waiting
for the opportunity, and rushed into the
city.</p>

<p>The Trojans were now suddenly
awakened from their repose, and, when
they went forth, they beheld their houses
in flames and the enemy filling the
streets. Most of the inhabitants were
put to the sword. Such is old Homer’s
story of the Wooden Horse.

<h2 class="no-break">
Hannibal crossing the Alps.<br>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most wonderful events related
in history, is that of Hannibal’s crossing
the Alps, with an army of many thousand
men, about two thousand years ago.</p>

<p>At that period, Rome, a city of Italy,
and Carthage, a city of Africa, were at
war. Hannibal was the Carthaginian
general, and, being in Spain with his
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_158">158</span>
army, he determined to lead them into
Italy. He, accordingly, crossed the
Pyrenees and entered France, in his
march. But now the Alps, the loftiest
mountains in Europe, lay between him
and Italy. They were not only many
thousand feet in height, but their tops
were covered with perpetual snow and
ice. There were no roads over these
cold and desolate regions, and no general
had ever before thought of leading
an army across them.</p>

<p>But Hannibal was a bold and enterprising
man. He did not follow in the
footsteps of those who had gone before,
but struck out new paths for himself.
He carefully examined the mountains,
and, while he thus saw the difficulties,
he felt sure that they could be overcome.</p>

<p>It must have been a strange and interesting
sight to have seen the soldiers
climbing up the steep, shaggy sides of
the mountains, creeping along the dizzy
edges of the precipices, crossing the
dark and narrow ravines, and ascending
and descending the steep and slippery
glaciers. It must have been curious to
have seen the elephants, of which there
were several hundreds attached to the
army, climbing over the lofty peaks of
the mountains. It must have astonished
the inhabitants of Italy to have seen the
vast army, after crossing a barrier regarded
as insurmountable, now pouring
down upon their smiling plains like an
overwhelming torrent, and spreading the
terrors of war on every hand.</p>

<p>This achievement of Hannibal has
ever been regarded as one of the wonders
of history. A little more than forty
years ago, Buonaparte, also, crossed the
Alps with a large army; but he enjoyed
many advantages not possessed by the
Carthaginian hero. He had better equipments,
tools and implements for his purpose,
and possessed far more skilful
engineers. His soldiers, also, were better
fitted to aid in such an enterprise.
The achievement, however, is esteemed
one of the greatest exploits in the life
of Napoleon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> left our party of adventurers at a
moment of deep interest. Young Joinly
and the greater portion of his companions
were posted near the house in which
the captain of the Tiger, with some of
his officers, was then stationed. Bushnell
and his associate had just returned
from the ship, to which they had attached
their little magazine of powder, with the
mechanism intended to explode it in half
an hour.</p>

<p>Guided by one of their party, who had
waited for them, they now joined the
little band we have just mentioned. The
position of the party commanded a view
of the ship, and, amid the intense darkness,
her position was known by the
light at her bow. When Bushnell arrived,
and communicated to Joinly and
his friends the success of the enterprise,
thus far, and assured them that the vessel
would be torn in pieces in the space
of a few minutes, it may be well imagined
that their anxiety was intense.</p>

<p>Keeping their eyes fixed in the direction
of the ship, they gazed earnestly, and,
more than once, the false and flickering
light of the strained vision was taken
to be the scintillations of the kindling
explosion. In this state of suspense,
seconds were lengthened to minutes, and,
ere the half hour had elapsed, the whole
party felt that the time had gone by, and
began to fear that the mechanism had
failed and the scheme miscarried.
Young Joinly, in particular, from the
impetuosity of his temper and the excited
state of his feelings, experienced an impatience
he could scarcely repress.</p>

<p>Nothing is so hard to endure, particularly
to an ardent mind, as inaction in
a protracted state of doubt and fear.</p>

<p>“It is all over,” said Joinly; “the
engine has failed; let us attack the
house!”</p>

<p>“Hush, hush!” said Bushnell, whose
nerves were more steady; “the time has
not arrived; the engine will yet do its
work: you will hear from it within five
minutes.”</p>

<p>A perfect silence among the party now
ensued, and nothing was heard, save the
raging of the tempest. A few minutes
passed, and a small flash was seen near
the water’s edge and beneath the stern
of the vessel. “There you have it,”
said Bushnell; and, a moment after, a
terrific light streamed up from the water,
seeming to envelope the mighty hulk of
the vessel, while a ruddy reflection tinged
every rope and spar, as well as the surface
of the sea and the little huts of the
adjacent village. A heavy sound followed,
and a rushing impulse of the air.
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_163">163</span>
Darkness again settled upon the scene,
and the hoarse moan of the tempest
seemed once more to drown every other
sound.</p>

<p>The eyes of the adventurers were now
turned upon the house where the captain
resided. But a few moments passed, when
there was a bustle within, and it was evident
that the phenomenon had been
observed. By this time, the conspirators
had surrounded the house, and Joinly
was on the point of entering the door,
when it was opened by the captain himself,
and, in the light, he saw Joinly and
his little band standing with their muskets
ready for action. “I command you
to surrender!” said Joinly, stepping forward
in the full blaze of the lamp. “Your
vessel is blown to atoms, and, if you make
the slightest resistance, both you and all
in this house shall be instantly shot
down!”</p>

<p>“Who are you? what are you?” said
the captain, in a state of profound astonishment.</p>

<p>“It is enough that we are Americans!”
said the youth. “There is no
time for parley. Do you surrender?”</p>

<p>“Not so easily!” said the officer, who
was now joined by two or three other
persons, slamming the door in the face
of the young commander.</p>

<p>“Now for it!” said Joinly; and, with
a thundering crash, several of the men
rushed against the door, which gave way,
and Joinly was pushed into the room.
Two or three of his men entered immediately
at his heels. The captain of the
Tiger fired his pistol, and the ball passed
between the left arm and the breast of
young Joinly.</p>

<p>A scuffle immediately followed, and
several random shots were exchanged.
In a very short space, the Americans
were victorious, having secured the five
British officers. Young Joinly had
thrown the captain upon the floor, where
he held him fast till the rest were mastered.

Finding it idle to resist, the British
officers submitted to their fate, and
were permitted to rise. The captain was
then commanded to prepare immediately
to depart, and the rest were tied, hand
and foot, and left separate from each
other in the different rooms of the house.</p>

<p>Having secured the chief object of
their expedition, Joinly and his party
made a hasty retreat, knowing that the
alarm would soon be communicated to
the troops stationed in the vicinity.
Taking a course which led around the
head of the bay, they made their way
to the sheltered spot where their little
sloop was anchored. The gale was still
raging; but, seeming not to heed it, they
released her from her moorings and put
her before the wind.</p>

<p>Keeping in to the land, they were
somewhat sheltered from the gale; but
still the little vessel seemed to dance
like a feather upon the wave. The
morning had now dawned, but the thick
haze rendered it impossible to see at any
great distance. As they were proceeding
in their course, they saw a large vessel,
scudding, like themselves, before the
wind. It was not long before they also
discovered that it was the Tiger, which
they had supposed blown to atoms, and
apparently in pursuit of them.</p>

<p>As soon as this idea entered the mind
of young Joinly, he stretched a little
more out from the land and hoisted an
additional sail. “We will give him a
chase,” said he, “and we will see which
shall have the best of it. Hurl-gate is
five miles ahead, and we will try which
shall get through it first.”</p>

<p>The men on board the boat had now
become so accustomed to the authority
of young Joinly, that they offered no
opposition to this wild and perilous suggestion;
but, taking their several stations,
each man well performed his part,
and the sloop, shivering in every plank
and seeming to partake of the excitement,
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_164">164</span>
skimmed like a sea-gull over the
water. The two vessels proceeded steadily
for some time, but it was at last obvious
that the Tiger was gaining upon
the sloop.</p>

<p>The captain, who had watched the
whole of the proceeding with intense
interest, now spoke and said to Joinly,
“Young man, you had better give it up;
you’ll soon be riddled with her shot.”</p>

<p>“Look yonder,” said Joinly, in reply,
pointing forward; “do you see the water
boiling in yonder whirlpool like a pot?”</p>

<p>“I do, I do!” said the captain, his countenance
assuming a look of the utmost
anxiety.</p>

<p>“That is Hurl-gate!” said the youth.
“<em>We</em> shall pass it in safety; but, if the
Tiger proceed five hundred fathoms
more, her escape is impossible, and her
doom certain.”</p>

<p>A general silence now prevailed, during
which the sloop passed safely through
the tumbling eddies of the whirlpool.
The frigate continued on her track, and
in a few moments she struck upon the
rocks. This circumstance was immediately
noticed on board the sloop, and a
general shout of triumph rang through
the air.</p>

<p>We must leave the frigate to her fate,
only remarking that, although she escaped,
with little damage, from the explosion
of the gunpowder, yet it was but
to find her doom in Hurl-gate. There
was only sufficient time for the men on
board to escape, when she went to pieces.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="Seven"><span class="allsmcap">VII.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>

<p>General Washington was now stationed
upon the west bank of the Hudson
river, about twenty miles from New
York. It was young Joinly’s scheme
to take his captive directly to the camp,
and solicit, in person, an exchange of
the British officer for his father. The
sloop was, therefore, turned up into a
little creek, where Joinly, with one of
his companions and the prisoner, were
landed. These proceeded on their journey,
while the rest of the adventurers
found their way safely back to Saybrook
in their little vessel.</p>

<p>In the space of two or three days, Joinly
reached the American camp, and was
soon conducted to the head quarters of
the commander-in-chief. That officer
was alone, and the young man was ushered
into his presence. He told his story
with simplicity, and closed with a
request that steps might be taken for the
release of his father.</p>

<p>“This is a strange feat you have performed,”
said Washington, “and you
must have had a strong motive for an
adventure so perilous.” The tears started
to the young man’s eyes as he replied,</p>

<p>“My father, sir, has been in captivity
for almost three years. His health is
wasted with toil, anxiety and care; his
fortune is scattered; his lands are impoverished;
his home is desolate. Are
not these motives which should make a
son forget his own safety and comfort,
and think only of his father’s release?”</p>

<p>“I can well believe that they are,” said
the general, in a softened tone; “I can
well believe that they are. I have not
the pleasure of a personal acquaintance
with your father, but I know that he is
a man of exalted worth. He has suffered
deeply for his country; but, alas! this is
what all are called upon to endure. He,
however, has some compensation, in
satisfying the promptings of a patriotic
breast and fulfilling the suggestions of a
kind and generous heart.</p>

<p>“My young friend, your father is
worthy of the effort you have made, and,
if I can reconcile it with my sense of
duty to the country, your object shall be
accomplished. There is one difficulty,
however, which you have overlooked.
Your father is a colonel, and the officer
you have captured is but a captain. Sir
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_165">165</span>
Guy Carleton will hardly make an
exchange so unequal as to give up the
former for the latter. However, if you
will call upon me to-morrow, you shall
know the result.”</p>

<p>Young Joinly now went away; but,
on the morrow, returned to the office of
the general at the time appointed. He
found him alone, as before. Washington
received him with that serene dignity,
that mixture of command and kindness,
which characterized him. After a
brief explanation, he handed the youth
a sealed packet, addressed to General
Carleton. “My young friend,” said he,
“you will take this to Sir Guy, at New
York. It contains a proposal for an exchange
of Colonel G——, a British officer,
who has been recently captured, for
your father. I regret that a specific exchange
of the officer you have yourself
taken, could not be proposed. It would
not be consonant to the rules of war, nor
would it be accepted by the British general.
Here is a letter to your father,
expressing my high sense of his generous
services and his patriotic sacrifices
in behalf of his country. And, for yourself,
remember that, if I can ever do you
a personal service, it will be cheerfully
rendered. Farewell.”</p>

<p>With a mingled feeling of affection and
awe toward this remarkable man, young
Joinly departed. Being duly provided
with a pass, he easily made his way to
New York, and presented his communication
to Sir Guy Carleton. The proposed
exchange was readily accepted,
and the youth was permitted to proceed
to his father’s quarters and communicate
the intelligence of his release.</p>

<p>With a beating heart, he entered a
boat, and proceeded to the barracks at
Brooklyn, upon Long Island, then occupied
by American prisoners of war. On
reaching the gate, he was permitted,
by the sentinel, to enter, and one of the
prisoners offered to conduct him to his
father’s room. He led him through a
long passage, and young Joinly noticed,
as he passed, a considerable number of
the prisoners. It is impossible to describe
the wasted and haggard aspect of
these miserable wretches. They were
ragged, and filthy, and emaciated. They
not only seemed to be deprived of the
comforts of life, but degraded by a feeling
of utter desolation and abandonment.</p>

<p>On reaching his father’s apartments,
Joinly was informed that he had gone to
visit some patients, at one of the prison-ships,
which was moored in the river
near at hand. As he passed by the
apartments of the prisoners, he noticed a
large room, in which there were several
persons lying upon beds of straw. These
were sick, and several of them were approaching
their end. Yet their companions
around them seemed to take little
heed of their sufferings or their condition.
Some were walking about, some
were talking, and others were disputing.
Rough words and strong oaths were frequently
uttered.</p>

<p>In a corner of this dismal room, there
was one group that riveted the attention
of the youth. Two persons were sitting
upon the floor, for there were no chairs
nor seats in the room. Between them
lay the cold, lifeless form of one of their
companions. Yet these persons, made
familiar with death, were shuffling a pack
of greasy cards over the dead body,
which they used as their table. Shocked
at the scene, and suffocated with the offensive
atmosphere, our youthful friend
hurried away from the apartments, and
went in pursuit of his father.</p>

<p>As he passed along, his mind was
busy in reflecting upon the scenes he
had witnessed. “I once thought,” said
he, mentally, “that I should like to be a
soldier, but I am getting to look upon his
vocation with horror. It seems that war
not only takes away the lives of men in
battle, but degrades and brutifies them
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_166">166</span>
in the prison-house. And my poor father,
too! It is in such scenes as these, the mere
sight of which makes my head giddy and
my heart sick, that my father has toiled
and suffered for the last three years.”
With reflections like these; the youth
proceeded, in a boat, to the prison-ship.</p>

<p>This was the hulk of a large ship of
war, which, being unfit for service, was
dismantled, anchored in the East river,
and converted into a prison. He mounted
the side of the enormous vessel, and
stood upon the deck. Standing, sitting,
or lying around, were a large number
of prisoners, bearing even deeper marks
of misery than those we have before
described. On making inquiries for
his father, the young man was told
that he was below.</p>

<p>He descended, accordingly, into the
bowels of the ship, though the revolting
atmosphere nearly stifled him. He was
conducted to a remote part of the vessel,
and pointed to a person sitting by
the side of a sick man, upon a couch of
straw. Although the back of the individual
was toward him, and the room
dark, he immediately recognised the
well-known form of his father. The
latter, however, was bent over the sick
man, and seemed intently occupied in
conversing with him.</p>

<p>Partly restrained from his emotions
at once more seeing his father, and in
such circumstances, and partly from an
unwillingness to break in upon such a
scene, young Joinly paused. His father,
unconscious of the presence of his son,
continued to address the sick man. “My
poor friend,” said he, in tones of the
utmost kindness, “set your heart at rest
upon that point. I induced you to join
the fatal expedition which resulted in
your captivity and mine. I assure you,
if I am ever delivered from this confinement,
and am restored to my home, your
wife and children shall never want for
the comforts of life.
</p>

<p>“Let not fears for them disturb these
last moments of existence. You will,
at least, leave the inheritance of a good
name to your children,—the reputation
of one who died in the service of his
country. In the possession of such an
inheritance, they can never suffer from
poverty or neglect. This fearful war
must soon end, and it will result in the
independence of our country. Let it
lighten our hearts, and cheer even this
prison-house, and shed consolation upon
our dying moments, that we have been
permitted to participate in that suffering
which has made a nation free.”</p>

<p>“My dear colonel,” said the poor man,
in a faint voice, “I thank you a thousand
times. I should now die in peace,
were it not for one painful thought.”</p>

<p>“And what is that?” said Colonel
Joinly.</p>

<p>“It is, that you will yourself be sacrificed
in these horrid dungeons. Your
constitution is failing, and you cannot
much longer sustain this wear and tear
of body and mind.”</p>

<p>“Do not let these thoughts trouble you,
my friend,” replied the colonel. “Having
made your peace, as I trust, with
God, let these last moments be peaceful
also; and fear not for me. I know no
other, and I seek no other path than that
of duty. There is a sun always shining
over that path, through whatever trials
it may lead. If it is Heaven’s will that
I be sacrificed, what better can I do than
fulfil Heaven’s decree?”</p>

<p>“But, colonel,” said the sick man, “it
is rumored, in the ship, that an exchange
is about to be offered to you. Many of
the prisoners are in despair lest you
should leave them, for you are their only
comfort. I know your character, and
fear that your sense of duty may lead
you to refuse to accept an exchange. Let
me pray you not thus to lay down your
life.”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay,” said the colonel, “fear
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_167">167</span>
nothing on that score. I am aware that
my health is failing, and I know that I
could not much longer endure the kind
of life I have led. If an exchange is
made, it is not for me to refuse. I assure
you, however, I would not leave
these poor prisoners to their fate if the
hope was not presented that, in being
released, I might make representations
to the British officers, and an appeal to
the American people, which should effect
something in their behalf. I have great
hopes of obtaining something from the
noble heart of Sir Guy Carleton, who
has succeeded the weak and heartless
Sir Henry Clinton.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you,” said the sick
man, earnestly. “I am now relieved
from every anxiety. Farewell, colonel;
you must now go to the other prisoners.
I trust we shall meet in a happier world
than this.”</p>

<p>Colonel Joinly pressed the poor man’s
emaciated hand beneath both his own,
while the tears fell down his cheeks.
The sick man folded his arms upon his
breast, and closed his eyes. The pallid
and wasted features showed the havoc
of suffering and disease upon a countenance
still youthful; but, amid the ghastly
aspect of death, there was a smile,
which seemed to show that the soul
within was at peace. Colonel Joinly
remained in his chair some moments,
his face buried in his hand. With a
strong effort, he then arose, and turned
to depart. He now met his son, who
had stood aside during the scene we
have described.</p>

<p>We shall not dwell upon the first interview
of the father and son. The
story of the latter was soon told, and
Colonel Joinly was apprized at once of his
own liberation and the gallant achievement
by which it had been accomplished.
Nearly overpowered with his feelings,
he was desirous of leaving the ship and
going to his own room. He, therefore,

mounted to the deck, for the purpose of
departing; but a scene awaited him here
which he had not anticipated.</p>

<p>The rumor of his exchange had reached
the prisoners, and a large number of
them had now assembled to express their
thanks and give vent to their sorrow.
They formed a line on each side, from
the companion-way to the ladder, and,
as he passed along, they reached out their
hands in token of farewell. Many of
them were in tears, and several were
earnest in their supplications to the colonel
to do something for their families,
or, perhaps, make an effort for their own
deliverance from their dungeon.</p>

<p>This painful and trying scene was at
last over, and the father and son soon
reached the apartment of the former. A
short time was spent in mutual inquiries
and explanations, and then preparations
were made for their departure. Colonel
Joinly’s first steps, however, were in behalf
of the suffering soldiers for whom
he had labored so long. He visited several
of the British officers in New York,
and especially Sir Guy Carleton. A
promise was given—and we are happy to
say that it was fulfilled—that the prisoners,
thenceforward, should receive the
care and attention due to Christian men.</p>

<p>The father and son now set out for
Saybrook, where they arrived in due
season. The colonel was greatly changed
by the suffering he had endured. His
tall and robust form was emaciated and
bent over; his hair had grown thin and
white, and his countenance had become at
once sallow and deeply furrowed with
traces never to be effaced.</p>

<p>It was obvious to all that his constitution
was broken, and that he had brought
back to his home but the wreck of that
manly form and dauntless spirit which
characterized him in earlier days. The
joy of his wife and family, at his return,
was chastened by this change in his appearance;
but they were still overflowing
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_168">168</span>
with gratitude, and content once more
settled upon the group around the fireside.</p>

<p>Colonel Joinly now returned to his
medical practice, devoting a large share
of his attention to the public interests,
and especially to the means of improving
the condition of the American prisoners
at New York. His shattered fortunes
were, however, never repaired. The
remainder of his life was spent in comparative
poverty and the imperfect health
which attends a broken constitution.
Still, he never repined, but found compensation
and consolation in the consciousness
of having discharged his duty,
and in the cheering reflection that his
sacrifices had been made in behalf of
that arduous, yet successful struggle
which resulted in the independence of
his country.

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> famous holiday takes place on the
25th of December. It is little observed, at
the present day, in comparison of what
it was in former times. Even in England,
it is now chiefly celebrated by family
parties and services in the churches,
these being decorated with evergreens.
In this country, it is little noticed, except
by persons belonging either to the
Catholic or Episcopal church.</p>

<p>In former times it was otherwise, especially
in England. The day was then
celebrated, in that country, by a great
variety of merry customs. It was common,
in those days, for persons, called
mummers, to promenade the streets,
dressed up in masks, and representing
fantastic characters. A group of these
jesters would sometimes go about, representing
Old Father Christmas, with a long
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_169">169</span>
beard, white shoes, high-crowned hat,
with scarfs and garters tied around it,
and a drum beating before him.</p>

<div class="divcenterimg60">

<p>He was attended by a numerous family
of children, among whom Roast-beef,
Plum-pudding, &amp;c., were conspicuous.

There was another character in this
group, called Misrule, who was a great
rowdy, and made a vast deal of sport on
these occasions. He was a great fat fellow,
with an enormous hat, and he strutted
forward, playing on a musical instrument.
These maskers went from place
to place, during Christmas, exciting a
great deal of mirth and amusement
wherever they went.</p>

<p>As Christmas is the anniversary of
the birth of our Saviour, we cannot see
much propriety in these amusements,
and we think it is well that they have
passed away. There was another custom,
that of singing Christmas carols,
which is also laid aside.</p>

<p>This was done by a party of singers,
who went about, from house to house,
on Christmas eve, singing their songs in
honor of the Virgin Mary and the nativity
of Christ. They were generally welcomed
by the people, and often received
a loaf of brown bread, a pot of beer, and
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_170">170</span>
some few silver pennies. Sometimes,
late at night, by the chill rays of the
moon you would see an old man and
the a boy carolling beneath the windows,
hoping to be compensated for their harsh
and grating music.</p>

<p>Many other of the Christmas ceremonies
of England, which were in
vogue two centuries ago, have passed
away, and the occasion is more quietly
and more properly noticed by religious
services, acts of charity to the poor, a
meeting of friends, and a general diffusion
of cheerfulness and festivity.</p>

The Life of Columbus.<br>
</h2>
<h3>
<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="Five"><span class="allsmcap">V.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>
</div>

<p class="center"><i>Columbus sails on his second voyage.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> discovery, which Columbus had
made, was everywhere deemed of great
importance. But its vast results were
not yet foreseen. Curiosity was alive.
Ferdinand and Isabella themselves were
anxious to follow up the discovery which
had been made, and they authorized Columbus
to fit out, at their expense, a large
expedition for the new world.</p>

<p>By September, three ships, and fourteen
smaller vessels, were equipped and
manned, ready for the voyage. On the
25th of that month, this fleet sailed from
the bay of Cadiz. We shall not stop to
relate the incidents of this voyage, excepting
some interesting events which
took place at one of the Caribbee islands.
These islands were discovered by Columbus
during this voyage. One of
these islands goes by the name of Guadaloupe,
which was given to it by Columbus
himself.</p>

<p>On the 4th of November the fleet
reached this island, and here several of
the Spaniards landed. What was their
surprise to find human sculls and bones
in the houses of the natives, and many
other evidences that the people were cannibals,
or eaters of human flesh!</p>

<p>From this point, Columbus proceeded,
with his fleet, to some distance, where
he found a more commodious harbor.
Here they discovered several persons
who had been recently killed, and whose
limbs the natives had put upon the fire
to roast. These were captives, taken in
a war which was then waging between
the people of this island and the people
of islands not far distant.</p>

<p>While Columbus remained here, a
number of female captives made their
escape, and fled to the Spaniards for
safety. These Columbus took with him
on his voyage. He was now in great
trouble. He wished to hasten his departure;
but a party of nine men, who
had gone ashore, had not returned. The
next day no tidings were heard of them.
Great fears were entertained that they
might have fallen into the hands of the
savages, and been eaten at one of their
feasts.</p>

<p>Columbus was unwilling to leave the
place without knowing something more
certain as to the fate of these unfortunate
men. In this state of anxiety, a bold
young man, belonging to the fleet, offered
to go, with a party of forty men, in search
of them.</p>

<p>This offer was accepted, and the party
now went forth on their hazardous expedition.
They marched all day, making
search in every place—in the open country
and in forests—but all in vain. They,
themselves, met with no accident, but
they could hear no tidings of their lost
companions.</p>

<p>Some days had now elapsed since
their departure. Columbus was reluctant
to leave the island, since it was possible
that they might have become lost
in some extensive forest. But the greater
probability was, that they had fallen
a sacrifice to the cannibals.</p>

<p>Orders were at length given to make
sail. Just at this critical moment, the
long-lost party were discovered on the
shore, making signs to their departing
companions. It was a fortunate and
joyful discovery. A little longer, and
the poor fellows must have been left to
have fallen into the hands of the savages,
who would have feasted upon their
bodies. Boats were despatched, which
quickly brought them on board, worn
out with fatigue and anxiety, reduced
by famine, and their bodies wounded by
briars and thorns. They had lost their
way; they had wandered about, through
forests and through thickets, and had
arrived at the shore just in time to escape
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_172">172</span>
being left to perish in an inhospitable
land.</p>

<p>Columbus now continued his voyage,
and, on the 27th, cast anchor about a
league from the spot on which he had
built the fort of La Navidad, and where
he had left a party of Spaniards, as we
have related, to await his return.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="Six"><span class="allsmcap">VI.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>

<p class="center"><i>What took place in the new world.</i></p>

<p>Columbus, as I said, arrived off the
fort of La Navidad on the 27th of November,
1493. It was in the evening
when the fleet cast anchor. The fort
could not be distinguished, but many an
eye was turned that way, hoping to discover
some light. But nothing was seen.
Columbus now directed some cannon to
be fired, to give the people in the fort
notice of their arrival.</p>

<p>No sooner were the guns fired, than
all on board listened for an answer, and
looked for a signal in return; but they
looked and listened in vain. All was
dark and solitary. What could this
mean? No one was prepared to answer;
but all secretly, and some even aloud,
prophesied that some dreadful disaster
had befallen the people of the fort. Nothing,
however, could be certainly known
until the morning. This was, therefore,
waited for with no little anxiety and impatience.</p>

<p>About midnight, however, several Indians,
from the island, came on board.
They were persons whom Columbus had
seen before. One was a relation of
Guacanagari, the chief of the Indians in
that part of the island.</p>

<p>These Indians informed Columbus of
the sad fate of the Spaniards. They
were almost all dead. Some had fallen
sick and perished; some had quarrelled
among themselves; some had separated
from the rest; and the few, who he believed
to survive, were in another part
of the island. They also told Columbus
how Coanabo, a mighty chief, had, during
his absence, come from the mountains
of Cibao, and had nearly ruined
Guacanagari and his people; that their
chief had been wounded in battle, and
was still confined.</p>

<p>The following day, a party from the
fleet went on shore, and visited the fort.
It was a heap of ruins. Suspicions
were now entertained that all was not
right on the part of Guacanagari and his
people. Several circumstances seemed
to indicate that they had been concerned
in the murder of the Spaniards. One
fact, that excited the suspicions of Columbus
more than all others, was that
none of the Indians came near him. A
few were seen lurking about, but they
were shy. The country looked desolate
and deserted.</p>

<p>After a time, however, the truth came
out. The Spaniards had wrought their
own ruin. They had quarrelled; they
had abused Guacanagari and his people;
they had separated from one another.
Some had died through their own indulgences;
and a party, who had wandered
into the dominions of Coanabo, had been
seized by him and put to death. After
their death, Coanabo had raised an
army, had invaded the territories of
Guacanagari, had routed his people,
wounded him, and burnt his village.</p>

<p>This was sad intelligence for Columbus,
and cast a gloom not only over his
mind, but over the minds of all on board
the fleet. Columbus, however, lost no
time in searching for a suitable spot on
which to commence a settlement. One
was, at length, found, about thirty miles
from La Navidad; and here was commenced
the building of a city, which
Columbus named Isabella, after the queen
of Spain.</p>

<p>At length, when matters were somewhat
settled, Columbus despatched twelve
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_173">173</span>
of the vessels to return to Spain. He
remained in the new world to superintend
the affairs of the colony.</p>

<p>Not long after the sailing of the fleet,
Columbus experienced a severe trial.
He was himself worn out with fatigue,
and became seriously ill. To add to his
trouble, several of the colonists became
uneasy and were mutinous. For a time,
affairs assumed a serious aspect. But,
fortunately, through the firmness and
good management of Columbus, the difficulties
were settled.</p>

<p>Columbus now made preparations to
explore the island. This he did himself,
in company with a select band of men.
With this expedition, Columbus was
highly gratified. After his return to
Isabella, he sailed on a visit to Cuba,
and, during his voyage, discovered the
important island of Jamaica.</p>


<h3>
<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="Seven"><span class="allsmcap">VII.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>What happened during the absence of Columbus
on an exploring voyage, and other matters.</i></p>

<p>Some time before Columbus departed
on his voyage, he had erected a fortress
in the mountains of Cibao, within the
territory of Caonabo. When completed,
he gave the command of it to Pedro
Margarite, who had with him fifty-six
men. To these he afterwards added a
reinforcement of twenty men, having
learned that the fort was in danger of an
attack from Caonabo.</p>

<p>Pedro was ordered to explore that part
of the country still farther, and, during
his absence, to leave the fortress to the
care of Alonzo de Ojeda. With this he
complied. But, instead of exploring
that part of the country which he was
required to do, he went into a different
region, where he and his men conducted
themselves towards the Indians most
improperly.</p>

<p>This conduct, Don Diego Columbus,

the brother of the admiral, who had accompanied
the latter in his voyage to
the new world, and who now had command
of the colony during the absence
of Columbus, heard of, and sent a letter
to Pedro, ordering him to conduct differently.
This, Pedro greatly resented, and,
suddenly leaving the command of the
men, came to Isabella, and, seizing a
ship, went on board of it, with other enemies
of Columbus, and sailed for Spain,
with a design to do him there all the injury
in his power.</p>

<p>I said Ojeda now had the command
of Fort Thomas. He was a bold, brave
man. He was small in stature, but he
had nearly the strength of a giant.
When Caonabo found that Pedro had
abandoned that part of the country, and
had taken off a large part of the garrison
with him, he assembled ten thousand
men, well armed, and, secretly passing
through the forests, suddenly came upon
Fort Thomas, with the hope of cutting
off Ojeda and his men at a single blow.
Ojeda, however, was not to be taken by
surprise. He was ready for his enemy
at all times. Caonabo now besieged the
place, and, for thirty days, watched it as
a tiger would watch for his prey. By
this time, the men in the fort were reduced
to great want, but they were determined
never to yield. They often
made sallies from the fort, and slew many
of Caonabo’s bravest warriors. At length,
finding it impossible to take the fortress,
Caonabo and his men retired.</p>

<p>Not long after the return of Columbus,
Ojeda proposed to him a plan by which
to seize Caonabo. To get possession of
him was eminently important for the
peace and safety of the Spaniards. He
was a mighty chieftain, and their implacable
foe,—bold, cruel and desperate.
Columbus listened to the plan of Ojeda,
and, although he thought it wild and
dangerous, he at length consented to it.</p>

<p>At the head of a party of brave men,
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_174">174</span>
Ojeda took up his march through the forests
into the dominions of Caonabo.
Having found him, he proposed to him
to accompany him to Isabella, there to
enter into a treaty of peace and friendship
with Columbus.</p>

<p>Ojeda told him that, if he would go
and enter into such a treaty, he should
have the bell upon the church of Isabella.
This was a powerful temptation;
for nothing had struck the Indians with
more wonder and admiration than the
sound of this bell. Caonabo himself
had heard the sound of it, in some of
his secret prowlings around Isabella.
He had listened to it with rapture, and
now the offer of it determined him to
accompany Ojeda. But, when the time
came, Caonabo appeared at the head of
a large body of warriors.</p>

<p>“Why is this?” asked Ojeda. “Are
you not going as a friend?”</p>

<p>“O yes,” replied Caonabo; “but, as
I am a king, I must appear like one.”</p>

<p>Finding Caonabo unwilling to go without
his warriors, Ojeda consented that
they should accompany him. One day,
while on their return, they came to a
river, on the banks of which they halted.
Here Ojeda proposed that Caonabo
should bathe; after which, he should
mount his horse, and ride in state. To
this, Caonabo consented, highly pleased
with the idea of riding so fine an animal.
Ojeda, accompanied by Caonabo
and the Spaniards, now went a short
distance, into a retired spot, and bathed.
On coming out of the water, Caonabo
was assisted to mount the horse behind
Ojeda. When mounted, a set of beautifully
polished steel shackles were fastened
round the feet of Caonabo. To
these he had no objection, not knowing
for what they were intended, but supposed
they were designed to add honor
to him as a prince.</p>

<p>Ojeda and the Spaniards now mounted,
and, with Caonabo following, now
rode in among the warriors, making
their horses prance and appear as fine
as they were able. With this manoeuvre,
the Indians appeared to be well
pleased. Ojeda had made known his plan
to his followers. So, riding round and
round, they at length went to a considerable
distance from the warriors. All
at once, Ojeda gave the word of command,
and the whole party of horsemen
fled with their prisoner.</p>

<p>It was a bold project; yet it succeeded.
The Indians were unable to equal
the speed of the horses. Ojeda and his
companions were soon out of sight, and
far off at a distance from the warriors
of Caonabo. It was in vain for him to
attempt to escape. The shackles held
him fast. But, at length halting, they
bound him tight, and thus he was conducted
in safety to Isabella.</p>

<p>Columbus was rejoiced to have him
in his power. He was deemed to have
forfeited his life by killing the Spaniards
belonging to Fort La Navidad, and destroying
that fortress. He was therefore
detained as a prisoner by Columbus,
who intended, at a proper time, to
have him conveyed to Spain.</p>

<p>Caonabo was a proud chief. Even
in confinement he carried himself loftily.
Towards Columbus, he appeared to bear
the bitterest hostility, while, to Ojeda, he
gave much credit for his sagacity. We
shall here add, respecting the fate of
Caonabo, that, some time after, Columbus,
on returning to Spain, took this
haughty chief with him. But he died
during the voyage.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="Eight"><span class="allsmcap">VIII.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Columbus returns to Spain.</i></p>

<p>I have related how Pedro Margarite
seized a ship, and, with some others, fled
to Spain. Here they found full exercise
for their enmity to Columbus. They
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_175">175</span>
accused him of many wicked acts, which,
though unfounded, obtained some credit,
and served to lessen his justly-acquired
popularity.</p>

<p>The king and queen, thinking, perhaps,
that all was not right, despatched
a man, by the name of Aguado, to see
how matters stood, and to assist in preserving
the tranquillity of the colony.</p>

<p>No sooner had Aguado arrived at Isabella,
than he began to assume a tone of
authority, and to treat Columbus as an
inferior. Among other things, he endeavored
to hunt up accusations against
him, which he might present to the court
of Spain on his return.</p>

<p>Perceiving what was going forward,
and what was intended against him, Columbus
determined to return to Spain at
the same time that Aguado did. On
the 10th of March, 1496, both embarked
in different vessels. After a fatiguing voyage
of three months, they landed at Cadiz.</p>

<p>On his arrival in Spain, Columbus
found that his enemies had been at work
in good earnest. They had spread various
injurious reports about his management.
Although these reports had doubtless
reached the king and queen, they
received him with great kindness, and
treated him with attention.</p>

<p>In the autumn of that year, a large
sum of money was ordered to be advanced
to Columbus, in order to fit out
another expedition under his command.
Various circumstances occurred, however,
to delay the sailing of the vessels,
and it was not until the 30th of May,
1498, that Columbus was enabled to
leave Spain on his third voyage for the
new world.</p>


<h3>
<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="Nine"><span class="allsmcap">IX.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Third voyage of Columbus—Fresh troubles.</i></p>

<p>Columbus left Spain, on his third voyage,
in May, 1498. During this voyage,

he and his men suffered greatly in being
becalmed, in the middle of summer,
within the tropics. For eight days, they
could make no progress, but lay motionless
upon the water, under the heat of a
scorching sun. So intense was the heat
that they could scarcely breathe. Their
meat spoiled, and they lost nearly all
their wine and water.</p>

<p>At length, they were enabled to proceed,
and, on the 31st of July, to their
inexpressible joy, they discovered the
island of Trinidad. At this time, they
had but one cask of water remaining in
the ship. On the 30th of August, Columbus
arrived at Hispaniola. During
this voyage, he had suffered greatly from
watching and fatigue, from fever and
gout. Yet he indulged the hope that
his constitution, which had been uncommonly
good, would recover itself after
his arrival. But Columbus was destined
to new toils and new trials. He found
the colony in a sad state. The Spaniards
had experienced troubles during
his absence. They had had wars with
the natives, difficulties with one another,
indolence had prevailed, and a famine
had almost ensued.</p>

<p>We must pass over many interesting
particulars, and content ourselves with
letting our readers know, in general,
that, after the return of Columbus, affairs
proceeded still very badly. Many
of the Spaniards in the new world
were hostile to Columbus, resisted his
authority, formed conspiracies against
his government, and continued to send
home complaints against him to Spain.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate for Columbus that
the expectations of the people in Spain
had been raised so high, respecting the
wealth of the new world. They expected,
from the accounts which had
been received about the gold found there,
that Spain would become rich in consequence
of this discovery.</p>

<p>Even Ferdinand and Isabella had their
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_176">176</span>
hopes greatly raised. But, at length,
they found that they were obliged to be
at continual expense for the support of
the Spaniards in the new world. This
tended to lessen their gratification at the
discovery, and prepared them to listen,
with less reluctance, to complaints
against Columbus.</p>

<p>For a time, they continued to regard
him with kindness, and were unwilling
to admit the truth of complaints which
were made against him. But they were
so numerous, so often repeated, so confidently
asserted, that, at length, they
began to doubt whether all was right on
the part of Columbus.</p>

<p>His enemies were now about triumphant.
The king and queen appointed
a man, by the name of Bobadilla,
to repair to Hispaniola; as governor,
to assume the administration;
and, at the same time, they required Columbus
to surrender everything into his
hands. Having made an examination,
if Columbus and his brothers were found
to have abused their authority, their
power was to be taken from them altogether.</p>


<h3>
<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="Ten"><span class="allsmcap">X.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>

<p class="hanging"><i>Columbus arrested, and sent home in chains—His
fourth voyage—His sufferings and death.</i></p>

<p>Bobadilla arrived at Isabella in July,
1500. Columbus, at this time, was in
another part of the island. No sooner
was the former landed, than it was apparent
to the friends of Columbus, especially
to his brothers, what he intended.
He began to issue his commands as chief
of the island, and took possession of the
house of Columbus and everything in it.</p>

<p>Soon after, this arrogant man summoned
Columbus to appear before him.
This was truly humbling to the exalted
mind of Columbus, conscious, as he was,
of no wrong. Yet he judged it wise to
suppress his feelings and comply with
the command.</p>

<p>But little did Columbus expect such a
reception as he met with. Little did he
imagine that it was in the power, even
of enemies, to treat him with so much
injustice and indignity as he now experienced.
No sooner did he appear at
Isabella, than he was seized, loaded with
irons, and confined to the fortress. His
brothers, Diego and Bartholomew, shared
a similar fate. They were separated
from each other, and Bobadilla, himself,
did not condescend even to see them.</p>

<p>Soon after, orders were issued for the
departure of a vessel for Spain; and in
that vessel went the noble Columbus and
his brothers as prisoners and in irons.
What a reverse of fortune! How often
have the benefactors of mankind met
with unkindness from those from whom
they had a right to expect gratitude!
How often have they met with injustice,
where they ought to have experienced
honor and reward!</p>

<p>It was, doubtless, trying to Columbus
to be thus seized, imprisoned, and loaded
with chains, and sent home apparently
disgraced; but it must have been most trying
of all to him to have met with insults
and hoots from the multitude who had
assembled to witness his departure. The
voyage was short. The master of the
vessel treated Columbus with kindness
and respect, which served to soften the
troubles which now preyed upon his
wounded spirit.</p>

<p>When Columbus arrived in Spain,
and in chains, there was a general burst
of indignation, throughout the country,
that he should have been thus treated.
The king, therefore, pretended that he
had no share in this treatment of the
discoverer of the new world, and ordered
him to be set at liberty. It seems, however,
that the heart of the monarch was
turned from him; for, during nine long
months, Columbus remained in neglect,
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_177">177</span>
and, finally, the king appointed Nicholas
Ovando governor of Hispaniola.</p>

<p>It was at last decided that Columbus
should proceed on a fourth voyage, which
was commenced May 9th, 1502. His
powers were indeed restricted, and his
constitution shattered; but still he panted
for new adventures and discoveries. He
had this time four small ships and one
hundred and fifty men.</p>

<p>His particular object now was to discover
a passage to India through the
Gulf of Mexico. After coasting along
the shores of this gulf, and making various
discoveries, he was forced, by the
crazy state of his ships, to return to Hispaniola.
He stopped at Jamaica, and
finally arrived at Santo Domingo. After
experiencing a great variety of sufferings,
he departed for Spain, where he
arrived in November. On reaching Seville,
he heard of the death of his friend
and patron, queen Isabella.</p>

<p>The sun of prosperity had now set
upon Columbus. He was suffered to
linger in neglect and poverty. He was
also attacked with sickness, and detained
till 1505, at which time, weary and exhausted,
he arrived at Segovia, the seat
of the Spanish court. Here he applied
to the king for redress, but this was denied
him. He lingered a year longer in
obscurity and poverty, till death gave
him relief. He died at Valladolid, on
the 20th of May, 1506.</p>

<p>Thus ended a noble and glorious career,
and one which teaches us a sad
lesson of the wrongs, injustice and cruelty
of kings. As if to make some
amends for the sufferings of Columbus,
his remains received a pompous funeral,—a
circumstance, however, which shows
that his merit was known, and that those
who had injured him were conscious of
the wrongs they had done him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is curious to observe the interest
attached to everything connected with a
great man. We love especially to visit
the residences of those who have excited
our admiration either by their writings
or their actions. It may be pleasant to
our readers, therefore, to see the picture,
on the opposite page, of the cottage of
Washington Irving, a pleasant and amusing
writer, who has acquired great reputation.
There are very few persons,
in this country, who have not read some
of his books.</p>

<p>The cottage, of which we have given
a picture, is situated in a secluded spot,
on the eastern bank of the Hudson river,
a considerable distance above New York.
The place is called Sleepy Hollow, and
is the scene of one of Mr. Irving’s best
stories. The building is a curious one,
seeming to partake partly of the English
and partly of the Dutch style of
architecture.</p>

<p>The place is remarkable for the quiet
and tranquillity that reign around. The
whistle of the quail and the tapping of
the woodpecker are almost the only
sounds that are heard.</p>

<p>In this delightful spot Mr. Irving fixed
his residence some years ago. But,
about two years since, he was appointed
minister to Spain, and in this capacity
he is now living at Madrid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> I were to give a minute account of
all that happened while I was with the
Indians, it would fill a large book. Perhaps
I may, some time or other, give a
more particular account of my adventures;
but I must now condense my narrative,
and give only the leading events
of my life with the Indians.
</p>

<p>I continued for nearly six years with
the tribe of Kickapoos, who first made
me their captive. During this period
these Indians frequently shifted their
abode, partly with a view to the acquisition
of game, and partly to escape the
neighborhood of troublesome enemies.
We had occasional skirmishes with other
tribes, and once a serious war with
the Osages.</p>

<p>Small companies of white hunters
and fur traders sometimes visited our
camp, taking our furs, and giving us
powder, ball and trinkets in return. The
trade in furs became more and more an
object to the tribe, and, finally, it was a
part of their system to despatch some of
the men every winter to the mountainous
country at the west, for the purpose of
killing foxes, wild-cats, and other animals,
in order to obtain their skins.</p>

<p>I accompanied one of these parties,
which consisted of eleven men. We
proceeded, early in the autumn, to the
Rocky Mountains, and, hearing that game
was very abundant on the other side,
we traversed that immense range, and
found ourselves upon its western slope.
We came to a river, which, it was said,
emptied its waters into a great salt lake.
Impelled by curiosity, we continued our
ramble to the westward, and, at last,
reached the shores of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Novelty strikes even the imagination
of the savage. Our party were, therefore,
not a little excited when they gazed
at the boundless sea, and noticed the
greenish tinge of its waters. When
they tasted it, and perceived its salt and
bitter flavor, they spit violently, and uttered
a great many exclamations of astonishment.
It was here that I first saw
a ship. This was one of the American
vessels, going to trade with the Indians
on the north-west coast, and obtain their
furs. She passed near us, and I could
easily distinguish her sails, her ropes,
and some of the men. I had often
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_180">180</span>
heard of the white people, since I had
been with the Indians, but nothing I had
ever seen had given me such an idea of
their skill and power as did this vessel.</p>

<p>We lingered along the shores of the
Pacific for some weeks, and here we met
with various tribes of Indians. Some
of these were called Flat-heads, the upper
part of their heads being flattened,
by placing them in infancy between two
boards. It may seem difficult to account
for the prevalence of such a painful and
unnatural custom; but we must remember
that fashion governs the Indians as
well as the white people. Some of the
savages bore holes through their ears and
noses, for the purpose of suspending
jewels therein. Some submit to a burning
of the flesh, in order to tattoo the
skin; and those we have just mentioned
compress the skull between two boards.
These things are all done in compliance
with fashion.</p>

<p>We at last returned to the Rocky
Mountains, and spent the winter in the
pursuit of game. We killed a number
of wild sheep and wild goats, and several
beautiful little antelopes. These
creatures we found in small herds at
the eastern foot of the mountains. They
were exceedingly agile, with gentle,
black eyes and mild countenances, and
seemed to speed over the ground almost
as swiftly as a bird could fly.</p>

<p>Loaded with furs of various kinds, we
set out for our return. One night, as
we were encamped upon the banks of a
small river, we were attacked by a party
of about twenty Pawnees. Two of our
Indians were killed, and the rest escaped.
I was myself taken prisoner, and nearly
the whole of our furs fell into the hands
of the assailants.</p>

<p>I was now taken with my new captors
to the encampment of the Pawnees, a
distance of five days’ journey. I submitted
with apparent satisfaction to my
captivity, and, making myself useful,

soon acquired the favor of the people
among whom I was now adopted. I
had, however, no real attachment to
them, and determined to seize the first
favorable opportunity for my escape.
Several months passed, and I began to
be more reconciled to my lot, particularly
as I was now regarded as a leader among
the hunters of the tribe.</p>

<p>A plan was now set on foot for a marauding
expedition against the Indians
dwelling far to the eastward of our present
position. We had plenty of horses,
and thirty of us, well mounted and
equipped, set forth upon the proposed
adventures. We proceeded eastward,
and traversed a large extent of country,
and, at last, came within the vicinity of
some scattered settlements of white men.</p>

<p>I now discovered that it was the purpose
of my companions to attack these
settlements,—a circumstance which they
had before concealed from me. This
concealment probably arose from their
knowledge that I was of white descent,
and they were, perhaps, afraid that I
would not join them heartily in plundering
my own kindred.</p>

<p>At last, however, they told me their
scheme. Though I had been long with
the Indians, and had adopted their customs
and feelings, yet I was by no means
pleased with the idea of attacking these
white settlements. I knew it was unsafe
for me, however, to avow my scruples;
for, if their suspicion was excited,
they would not hesitate to send a bullet
through my heart. I therefore received
their proposition with apparent unconcern.
Perceiving, however, the keen
eyes of an old chief bent suspiciously
upon me, I thought it necessary to profess
an interest in the enterprise which
I did not feel.</p>

<p>The intention of escaping from the
tribe, which I had formerly cherished,
now revived, and an opportunity was
only wanting for me to take leave of
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_181">181</span>
them forever. While I was in this state
of mind, we came into the vicinity of a
small white settlement, consisting of four
or five houses. One of our party had
been in this quarter before, and knew
the situation of these dwellings. They
were all scattered, and one of them he
described as apart from the rest, and as
likely to afford considerable plunder.</p>

<p>It was thought best, however, before
making the attack, to gain more exact
information of the present state of things
among the settlers; and, with this view,
it was proposed that four of us should
paint and dress ourselves as Osages, and
pay a visit to these white people under
pretence of selling them furs. We
halted in the thick forest, and made our
preparations. Our party of spies then
set out on foot, and proceeded to visit the
houses of the white men. We found
five or six log-houses built upon the borders
of the White river, each of them
having some cleared and cultivated lands
around them.</p>

<p>A little higher up the stream, we came
to the other house which has been before
mentioned. It was larger than those
we have described, and had the appearance
of considerable comfort and thrift
on the part of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>When we entered the house, we saw
two women; one of them about middle
age, the other about sixteen. It was now
several years since I had been with the
Indians, during which period I had not
seen a white woman. The moment I
looked on those now before me, my former
associations and trains of thought
revived. We addressed the oldest of
the females, and asked for a cup of water.
She replied in tones of kindness and
courtesy, but I thought I could perceive
something of trepidation and anxiety in
her manner. Her voice, also, awakened
indescribable emotions in my breast.</p>

<p>The young lady soon brought us a
pitcher of water, and, when I looked
upon her, it seemed to me that I had never
beheld a creature so lovely. As the
man of the house was not at home, we
soon departed, and, as our business was
now accomplished, we proceeded straight
to our companions, whose lurking-place
we reached late in the evening. We
communicated the information we had
acquired, and it was soon resolved to
make an attack upon the last house we
had visited, the very next night.</p>

<p>The situation in which I now found
myself was most painful. The deepest
interest had been excited in my breast
toward those whom the savages had resolved
to sacrifice. The forms of the
mother and daughter continually haunted
my mind; and a strange fancy that it was
my mother and sister whom I had seen,
seized upon me. Improbable, impossible,
indeed, as this seemed when I considered
it calmly, there was still a conviction
resting upon my heart that I was
about to engage in assailing the dwelling-place
of my parents, with every chance
of sacrificing the lives of my kindred.</p>

<p>I was not long in resolving to take no
part in this murderous scheme, except to
baffle it. But what could be done? To
escape from the savages, forever on the
watch, and, doubtless, in some degree
suspicious of me, was a thing by no
means easily achieved. I determined,
however, to make the attempt, even if it
cost me my life.</p>

<p>It was the plan of the Indians to remain
where they were till about midnight,
then to proceed on horseback to
the vicinity of the settlements, and, having
tied the horses in some sheltered
spot, to go on foot to the assault they
meditated. Early the next evening, the
whole party laid down for the purpose
of obtaining some repose, their horses
having been fastened, so as to be at command.
I had taken care that my own
horse should be imperfectly tied, so that
I knew he would soon get loose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_182">182</span>
In the course of an hour, and after
most of the company were asleep, I heard
the animal moving about. I then rose
up, expressed some surprise, and remarked
that my horse was loose, and
that I must go and take care of him.
One or two Indians, who were still awake,
heard what I said, and, seeing nothing
suspicious in my conduct, I was permitted
to depart without interruption. I
soon caught my horse, and cautiously led
him away from the slumbering party.
When I had gone to the distance of fifty
rods, I mounted his back and plunged
into the woods.</p>

<p>For more than a mile I took a direction
opposite to the houses of the settlers.
Then, making a wide circuit, I turned
and pursued my way toward them. Coming
to the bank of the river, I was guided
in my course, and ere long reached the
first of those settlements which I had
visited with my Indian companions. I
now woke up the people in the several
houses, and, in the imperfect English I
was able to command, told them of the
attack that was meditated.</p>

<p>Four men, well armed, immediately
started with me for the house which was
to be the first object of attack. It was
nearly midnight when we arrived and
roused the inmates of the house. There
was no time to be lost, and immediate
preparations to receive the enemy were
made. In about an hour we saw their
dark forms gliding out from the edge of
the forest, and approaching the house.
With a soft and stealthy tread they approached.
Two of them seized upon a
large stick of timber, and were advancing
to the door, for the purpose of beating it
in, when I thrust my head out of the
window and uttered the war-whoop.
The astonished Indians started back, and
for a short time concealed themselves in
an adjacent thicket.</p>

<p>I knew that they would recognize my
voice, and understand that their plot was
detected, and that preparations were made
to repel it. I hoped, therefore, that they
would retire and give up their enterprise.
Such, however, was not their
determination. In a short time they
rallied, and, setting up the war-cry, advanced
with rapid steps toward the house.</p>

<p>I marked the leader of the band, whom
I knew to be the bravest man of the party,
and, presenting my rifle, I fired. The
Indian fell with a terrific scream. The
rest of the party halted. There was a
momentary bustle, and the savages disappeared.
We continued on the watch
till morning, and were then happy to
discover that the enemy had carried off
their wounded leader, and abandoned the
enterprise that had brought them hither.</p>

<p>I had been too intently occupied, during
the night, to think of much beside
the immediate business in hand, but I
now turned my eyes upon the inmates
of the house. These consisted of four
persons,—a husband and wife of middle
age, and a son and daughter now in the
flower of youth. The thought again
crossed my mind that here were my parents,
my brother and my sister. At
last, in the conviction that this was so, I
placed myself before the matron, and
said, as well as I knew how, “Did you
ever lose a son?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! why do you ask?” said
she, looking at me with intense curiosity.</p>

<p>“He is here,” said I.</p>

<p>“You my son?” said she.</p>

<p>But I cannot describe the scene. It
will be sufficient for the reader to know
that I had the happiness this day of being
restored to my family and saving them
from the perils of an Indian assault.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Where</span> have you been this week?”
“Me? I’ve been fishing.” “Catch anything?”
“Yes, a cold.” “Where were

<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="Eleven"><span class="allsmcap">XI.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>
<p class="center"><i>About Butterflies.</i><br>
</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> readers must not suppose that our
little hero had no interest in anything
but insects. It is true that his mind being
once engaged upon this subject, his
curiosity increased with his knowledge,
and for a time he preferred the study of
insects to that of anything else. At
one period, as I have told you, he was
greatly interested in beetles; then in spiders;
and then in bees. Finally he
turned his attention to butterflies. You
may be tired of my story, but you must
hear about this.</p>

<p>One beautiful summer day, he saw a
large butterfly seated upon a flower—its
wings were splendidly marked with figures
of brown, black and gold. They
were almost as large as the palm of his
hand. As the insect sat upon the flower,
he waved them up and down, seeming
to fan the blossom upon which it was
resting.</p>

<p>Jack’s first idea was to rush upon the
butterfly, and seize it. But he had now
acquired a habit of investigation. He
had lost that instinct which leads little,
thoughtless children to snatch at every
new and pleasing object. He was no
longer a mere child, but a thinking boy.
His mind was awake, and the pleasure
he derived from its exercise was a very
great pleasure.</p>

<p>So Jack, having approached near to
the butterfly, paused and examined it
carefully. He found that it had four
wings, two large and two small ones,
and that it had six legs, four only of
which seemed to be used.</p>

<p>While Jack was thus pursuing his
observations, he gradually drew nearer,
until the alarmed insect took to flight,
and, with a wavering motion, swept
across an adjacent meadow, until it was
lost in the distance. As Jack was in
the habit of thinking about what he had
seen, he mused upon the little butterfly,
and then he asked his Aunt Betsey
about it. She was ever ready to gratify
his curiosity, and so she proceeded to
tell him about butterflies, pretty much as
follows:</p>

<p>“You must know, my dear Jack,”
said she, “that the family of butterflies
is very numerous; this consists not only
of those which pass under the name of
butterfly, and which go abroad in the
daylight, but of those which are called
moths, and which fly about at night.</p>

<p>“The butterflies have ever been regarded
as among the most beautiful
objects in nature. They seem almost
like flowers or gems, which have become
endowed with life, and, taking wings,
soar away upon the breeze. Thus the
poet Moore speaks of them, as creatures</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0b">‘Which flutter round the jasmine stems,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like winged flowers, or flying gems.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Who, indeed, has not observed these
little creatures flying from flower to
flower, sipping the nectar from each, and
seeming only to think of the present
happy moment? And who has not
thought how like to happy, heedless,
children are these pretty butterflies?</p>

<p>“It is natural that the poets, who were
always looking out for beautiful things,
should seize upon such a subject as the
butterflies, and we therefore find them
often alluded to in poetry. Spencer, an
old English poet, thus describes one of
these insects,—and it is a very good description
too:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0b">‘The velvet nap which on his wings doth lie,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The silken down with which his back is dight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His broad, outstretched horns, his airy thighs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His glorious colors, and his glistening eyes.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The moths have also attracted the
attention of the poet; and as they are dazzled
by a lamp at night, and frequently
fly into it and scorch themselves to death,
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_184">184</span>
they have been often compared to giddy
youth, who rush thoughtlessly into dangerous
pleasures, and are thus lost forever.</p>

<p>“The butterflies and moths have not
only four wings and six legs, and two
horns or feelers, but they have a little
tube or proboscis, with which they suck
in the juice of flowers. When this is
not in use, it is nicely rolled up, and
packed beneath the head of the animal,
under a hairy cover made for the purpose.</p>

<p>“When examined with a glass, the body
of the insect appears to be covered with
hair, and the fine brilliant dust upon the
wings is found to consist of minute scales.</p>

<p>“But the eyes of butterflies, are, perhaps,
their most remarkable quality.
Some of these are simple, while others
are composed of a collection of magnifying
lenses. It is said that in some
butterflies the eye consists of sixteen
thousand lenses. If so, it would seem
that when a butterfly of this sort looks
at a person, he sees sixteen thousand
images of him! Of the butterfly tribe,
some live upon the honey of flowers,
others upon the leaves of plants, and
others upon dead wood. Some of them
subsist upon animal substances, and are
very destructive to woollen cloths, furs
and feathers. The honey-comb moth
we have already mentioned as often
infesting the bee-hive, and preying upon
wax.</p>

<p>“While the butterflies, in their perfect
state, have always attracted the attention
and excited the interest of mankind, the
wonderful steps by which they reach
their perfect state have not formed a less
interesting subject of observation. Most
insects have three states of existence;
they are first eggs, then worms, and then
the winged and perfect insect.</p>

<p>“But the transformations of the butterfly
have ever been regarded as very
wonderful. The female deposits her
eggs upon such plants as are proper to
nourish the little caterpillars which are
to proceed from them. The common
white butterfly places hers upon cabbages.
The tortoise-shell and peacock
butterflies place theirs upon nettles, &amp;c.
These are generally attached by a kind
of glue to the surface of the plant. The
moths are usually more careful, for they
generally deposit their eggs in some
concealed place, and wrap them up carefully
in a downy substance.</p>

<p>“Butterflies do not enshroud themselves
in a silken case, or cocoon, spun
from the mouth, as is done by many
other insects; but their process is more
wonderful. When the butterfly egg is
hatched, it produces a caterpillar. This
is a kind of heavy worm, usually furnished
with sixteen feet.</p>

<p>“It grows rapidly after changing its
skin, which process lasts three or four
minutes, and frequently proves fatal. It
is now furnished with twelve round eyes,
and feeds voraciously upon leaves. Having
reached its full size, it ceases to eat,
and retires to some solitary place to undergo
its wonderful transformation.</p>

<p>“Here it proceeds to form a mass of
silken threads, which it spins from its
mouth. This is attached to a proper
place, and the caterpillar is soon seen
suspended by the tail. It now raises its
head a little, giving a curve to its back.
This motion is repeated until a slit is
formed, first behind the head, and then
along the back. At length the skin of
the larva disappears, and the chrysalis
is formed. This consists of a smooth,
shining mass, speckled with gold.</p>

<p>“The newly-formed chrysalis of a
butterfly, when opened, is found to contain
only a mass of pap, in which no
trace of the limbs of the future butterfly
can be observed, yet the outer covering
is marked with all the external organs
of the future butterfly in a very short
time after the skin of the caterpillar has
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_185">185</span>
been cast off. On opening the chrysalis,
indeed, after a proper space, we shall
find, encased in separate parts, the wings,
eyes and other organs of the future butterfly.</p>

<p>“When the insect has remained in
this pulpy or chrysalis state for a proper
time, a motion may be perceived
within. The skin, which is now thin
and dry, gives way, and bursting into
four distinct and regular pieces, liberates
its little prisoner. This now emits a reddish
colored liquid, which superstitious
people have called bloody rain; its wings
rapidly assume their proper size, and it
joins its companions in the air. The
old poet Spencer thus happily describes
the new-born insect:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0b">‘When he arriving, round about doth fly</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">From bed to bed, from one to other border;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And takes survey, with curious, busy eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Of every flower and herb there set in order;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now this, now that, he tasteth tenderly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Yet none of them he rudely doth disorder;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor with his feet, their silken leaves deface,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But pastures on the pleasures of each place.’”</div>
</div>
</div>


<h3>
<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER</span> <abbr title="Twelve"><span class="allsmcap">XII.</span></abbr><br>
</h3>
<p class="center"><i>About insects in general.</i><br>
</p>

<p>I will now give my readers a short
chapter upon insects in general, extracted
from Aunt Betsey Piper’s talk to her inquisitive
nephew.</p>

<p>Insects are so called because they appear
to be divided into two parts, and
the word <em>insect</em> means <em>cut apart</em>. The
insect tribe are divided by naturalists
into several orders. The first consists
of those that never have wings, as the
spider, flea, louse, &amp;c.; the second consists
of those which have wings, but so
cased up as not to appear when first produced,
such as the grasshopper, earwig,
dragon-fly, &amp;c.; the third is of the moth
and butterfly kind; the fourth such as
come from a worm instead of a caterpillar,
as the beetle, bee, fly, gnat, &amp;c.</p>

<p>We are very apt to conceive that insects,

from their extreme littleness, are
very insignificant. But this is a wrong
view of the subject. In the first place,
they are exceedingly ingenious in their
structure, and wonderful in their habits
and instincts. A writer on natural history
says, that if we compare insects
with the higher ranks of nature, such as
quadrupeds, birds, &amp;c., we shall perceive
in the former all the peculiarities
which belong to the latter; the piercing
eye of the lynx and the falcon, the hard
shield of the armadillo, the splendid tail
of the peacock, the imposing horns of
the stag, the swiftness of the antelope,
the fecundity of the hare, the architectural
powers of the beaver, the climbing
powers of the squirrel, the gambols of
the monkey, the swimming of the frog,
the burrowing of the mole, and the leaping
of the kangaroo; all these things are
found amongst insects, and often, indeed,
in a redoubled degree. The eye of the
fly, with its thousand lenses, the scales
of the diamond beetle, the wonderful
works of the hive, the ingenuity of the
spider, the transformation of the butterfly,—these
and many other interesting
circumstances show that this class of
animated nature possesses strong claims
upon our attention.</p>

<p>The amazing extent of the insect
tribes also increases the interest of this
subject. In the royal collection at Berlin,
in Prussia, there are no less than
twenty-eight thousand species or kinds
of beetle. Celebrated naturalists have
calculated that there are, in the world,
five hundred thousand different kinds of
insects, and countless myriads of each
kind. It is said that one single insect
of the aphis or louse tribe may be the
living parent of six thousand millions of
descendants. If all the insects in the
world were collected into one heap, it
would doubtless rise ten times as high
as the top of Bunker-Hill monument,
near Boston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_186">186</span>
The importance of insects may be
gathered from another consideration.—Some
of them are very useful. The bee
we have already noticed. We may also
mention the cochineal insect, which exists
in great numbers in the East Indies
and in South America. It is a minute
creature, of the aphis tribe, one of which
is hardly so large as a peppercorn. Yet
it is produced in such quantities, that
many thousands of pounds are sent every
year, in a dried state, to America and
Europe. They contain a coloring principle,
called carmine, which produces an
intensely red color. These insects are
chiefly used for dying scarlet. In Brazil,
large estates are devoted to the cultivation
of plants, for the purpose of breeding
them. Great quantities are also
produced in different parts of Spain.</p>

<p>Among the useful insects, we may
notice the Spanish fly, which is about
three fourths of an inch in length, with
brilliant green wings. These are shaken
down from the trees, it being their habit
to feign death when disturbed. They
are called <em>cantharides</em>, and are used in
medicine, especially for producing blisters.</p>

<p>We might notice many other useful
insects, but must pass them by. We
might speak, also, of the beautiful fireflies,
which appear in myriads, during
the night, over our meadows and amid
the forests; of the glow-worms, which
seem to burn with a mild and steady
blaze, to illuminate the darkness; and
the great lantern moth of South America,
which is sometimes used to decorate the
heads of females, and several of which
will answer the purpose of a torch.</p>

<p>But we must pass over these wonderful
things, and consider that the surface
of the earth, the waves of the sea, and
the very atmosphere around the whole
globe, are all the abodes of countless
insects. Even the stalks and leaves of
plants are filled with them. If you will
take a microscope and look into the stalks
of certain plants, you will see thousands
of little busy, bustling insects there, all
of them seeming to be in the full enjoyment
of existence. Nay, if you will
apply the microscope to a tumbler of
pure water, you will see that this also is
filled with living things. Thus the poet
says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Full nature swarms with life; one wondrous mass</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of animals, creatures organized.</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">Through subterranean cells,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where searching sunbeams scarce can find a way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Earth animated heaves. The flowery leaf</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wants not its soft inhabitants. Secure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Within its winding citadel, the stone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Holds multitudes. But chief the forest boughs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That dance unnumbered to the playful breeze,</div>

<p class="center"><i>Conclusion.</i><br>
</p>

<p>I hope my readers are satisfied, by this
time, that Inquisitive Jack, in pursuing
the study of insects, was not wasting his
time. It not only gave him a great deal
of pleasure, but he obtained from it much
useful information. He went on, from
one step to another, until he understood
the whole science of insects, which is
called <em>Entomology</em>.</p>

<p>But I have told you the story of our
curious little friend, not so much to recommend
the particular study of insects,
as to show the utility of habits of observation
and investigation. You have
seen, by the story I have told you, that,
by means of these habits, Jack not only
enjoyed a great deal of pleasure and
satisfaction, but that he became a very
<span class="pagenum" id="v6Page_187">187</span>
learned man; but I must tell you, what
I have before intimated, that his whole
attention was not confined to insects.
He observed and investigated plants and
flowers, and thus became a botanist. He
studied into the habits and nature of
birds, and thus became an ornithologist;
and, in short, he mastered the whole field
of natural history. Perhaps I shall, some
time or other, give you an account of his
proceedings in relation to some of these
matters.</p>

The Close of the Year.<br>

<p><span class="smcap">Look</span> at the picture! It is winter—and the
old man is toiling through the deep, deep snow.
A heavy burthen is on his back; the sky is
dark and gloomy; the scene around is desolate
and chill. We can easily fancy that the heart
of the aged traveller is heavy; that his limbs
are weary; that a damp, cold moisture is upon
his brow, and an expression of bitterness and
sorrow around his lips; yet he plods stoutly
on—and why should he not? If he were to
despair, he would but make the snow his pillow,
and the sleety drift his winding-sheet. Beside,
he is not alone. A cheerful friend is with him;
a humble one indeed, yet one that will not desert
him, whether in sunshine or storm, in
summer’s joy or winter’s sorrow.</p>

<p>There is something of truth and nature in this
scene, and old Bob Merry feels that it may be
properly placed at the head of his annual goodby.
I cannot but entertain the idea that the
old man in the cut, may stand for my representative.
He has his burthen, and I my cares;
he is making his way through the heavy drift,
and I too am stumping it on, amid obstacles
and difficulties. He has his cheerful friend,
beckoning him on, and I, old and decrepit, am
attended by the angel of Hope, which ministers
to me, even when all beside have deserted me.
That hound in the picture may seem to tell the
weary and wayworn traveller of the home that
is at hand, of the bright hearth that burns for
him, of the warm hearts that are ready to receive
him. And Hope, the comforter, tells me too,
that there are some bright firesides where Bob
Merry is a welcome guest; where his monthly
visits are not a tax, but a pleasure; where to
him the latch of the door is free and the string
never pulled in.</p>

<p>These are my fancies—and though they may
be but the dreams of a conceited old man, I
will still cherish them. Real or fantastic, they
lighten my heart, cheer my steps, and give me
courage to pursue my journey.</p>

<p>And now, my gentle readers, we are at the
close of the old year! May it find you good
and happy. We are at the threshold of the
new year; may this, too, find you good and
happy. What better wish can I utter? And
will you continue for twelve months more, the
acquaintance which we have so long sustained?
Come! Black Eyes, Blue Eyes, and Grey Eyes—one
and all—let as pursue our rambles, and
I promise still to exert myself for your pleasure
and profit! I have some of Bill Keeler’s stories,
which I have picked up, and which I intend
to give you. I have some curious adventures
in South America; some stories of the Old Man
in the Corner, and other nuts to crack for you.
So, girls and boys, come along!</p>

<p class="p0 unindent"><span class="smcap">My dear Mr. Merry</span>:</p>

<p>In the last number of your Museum, you
wished your little readers to send you the
answers to twenty questions given to us. I
am quite a small boy, but I thought I would
try to answer them; and those that I may
answer wrong I should like to have you correct
in your next number, and oblige a little friend
and subscriber, who is yet too young to write
for himself.</p>

<p><i>1st question.</i> The five most remarkable quadrupeds
in Africa are the Lion, Zebra, Hippopotamus,
Camelopard, Hyena.(1)</p>

<p><abbr title="Second"><i>2d.</i></abbr> The three most famous animals in Asia
are the Elephant, Rhinoceros, and Lion.</p>

<p><abbr title="Third"><i>3d.</i></abbr> The Elephant is the largest quadruped,
and is a native of Asia.
</p>

<p><i>4th.</i> The Giraffe is the tallest animal in the
world, and found in Asia(2) and Africa.</p>

<p><i>5th.</i> The Ostrich is the largest bird, and
found in Asia and Africa.</p>

<p><i>6th.</i> The largest kind of serpent is the Boa
Constrictor, and found in Asia.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i> The smallest bird is the Humming-Bird,
and found in America.</p>

<p><i>8th.</i> The largest animal is the Elephant,(3)
and lives in Asia.</p>

<p><i>9th.</i> The Orang-Outang most resembles man,
and is found in Borneo, one of the East India
Islands.</p>

<p><i>10th.</i> The Horse is the most useful animal
to man.</p>

<p><i>11th.</i> The Bison is the largest quadruped
found wild in America.</p>

<p><i>12th.</i> The Grizzly Bear is the most fierce
and formidable wild quadruped in the United
States.</p>

<p><i>13th.</i> The Rattlesnake is the celebrated poisonous
serpent that belongs to the United
States.</p>

<p><i>14th.</i> I think the largest bird of prey in the
world is the Eagle.(4)</p>

<p><i>15th.</i> To the question, what are the two
most remarkable animals of New Holland?
I don’t know but one; that is the Kangaroo.(5)</p>

<p><i>16th.</i> The Eagle is the king of birds.</p>

<p><i>17th.</i> The Butterfly is the most beautiful of
insects.</p>

<p><i>18th.</i> The Bee is the most useful insect to
man.</p>

<p><i>19th.</i> The Dog seems most attached to man.</p>

<p><i>20th.</i> The Lion is the most powerful known
quadruped.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Merry, I have got through, and
I should like very much to know if I have
answered them right, and especially to know
the other remarkable animal of New Holland.</p>

Your little friend and subscriber,

<p>(1) Not <em>Hyena</em>, but <em>Rhinoceros</em>, of
which there are two kinds in Africa, the
one-horned and the two-horned.</p>

<p>(2) The <em>Giraffe</em> is not a native of
Asia.</p>

<p>(3) The largest animal is the <em>Whale</em>.</p>

<p>(4) The <em>Condor</em> is the largest bird
of prey.</p>

<p>(5) The other most remarkable animal
of New Holland is the <em>Duck-billed
Platypus</em>, a small quadruped, with fur
like a beaver, and a bill like a duck,
living chiefly around the water.</p>
